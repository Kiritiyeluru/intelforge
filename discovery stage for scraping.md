You're doing it right by building a fast scraping framework (Python+Rust combo is powerful). Now the next challenge isn't scraping ‚Äî it's **discovery**: *Where the hell is the good content to scrape?*

Let‚Äôs break it down:

## üîç How to **Search for Articles/Blogs** on a Topic Like "Momentum-Based Strategy"

### ‚úÖ 1. **Use Google, Intelligently (Advanced Queries)**

You can‚Äôt scrape what you can‚Äôt find. Google is still the best discovery tool ‚Äî but you need to search like a hacker:

#### üî∏ Advanced Google Search Operators

```
momentum strategy site:medium.com
momentum trading blog site:substack.com
momentum strategy filetype:pdf
momentum trading intitle:strategy inurl:blog
"momentum based strategy" intext:"backtest"
```

You can automate these with `serpapi`, `Google Search API`, or even `requests + bs4` (if you want to go gray-hat and scrape SERPs).

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Search GitHub for Code + Discussions**

GitHub has code + README content explaining strategies.

#### Use GitHub's search like this:

```
momentum strategy language:python stars:>10
"momentum trading" in:readme
topic:algorithmic-trading momentum
```

Automate discovery with GitHub's API or scrape repo search pages using `playwright`.

### ‚úÖ 3. **Use RSS Feed Aggregators & Blog Directories**

Scrape or query:

* [Feedly](https://feedly.com)
* [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/)
* [Alltop](https://alltop.com/)
* Blogrolls in niche forums

These aggregate blogs ‚Äî easier to crawl than random Googling.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Tap into Research Archives**

Scrape or crawl these:

* [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) ‚Üí "momentum strategy"
* [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/)
* [RePEc](https://ideas.repec.org/)

Use their search APIs or scrape the papers directly.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Scrape Forums & Community Posts**

People casually drop strategies on:

* Reddit (`r/algotrading`, `r/quant`)
* EliteTrader, Trade2Win, Bogleheads
* Quantocracy.com ‚Üí auto-curated blog links

These often link to niche blogs or GitHub repos.

### ‚úÖ 6. **Use Site Discovery Tools (Optional)**

If you want a more automated discovery pipeline:

| Tool                    | Use Case                                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scrapy Cluster**      | Distributed crawling across domains                |
| **Common Crawl**        | Massive dataset of scraped web ‚Äî can query via AWS |
| **SerpAPI**             | Google/Bing/Yahoo search API                       |
| **Sitemap Parser**      | Extract all URLs from known blogs                  |
| **Wayback Machine API** | Find old but gold strategy articles                |

## üõ†Ô∏è Do You Need Specialized Libraries to *Search*?

**Not really**, but these will help:

| Purpose                      | Library                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Google search scraping       | `googlesearch-python`, `serpapi`, or `playwright` |
| GitHub API                   | `PyGithub`                                        |
| Sitemap parsing              | `sitemap-parser`, `robotexclusionrulesparser`     |
| Feed discovery               | `feedparser`, `newspaper3k`                       |
| Full-text search on a corpus | `whoosh`, `elasticsearch`                         |

## ‚ö° Your Pipeline Could Be:

1. **Search or scrape** SERPs, GitHub, RSS/bloglists
2. **Extract URLs**
3. **Filter pages that match strategy keywords**
4. **Scrape content (article, blog, PDF, README)**
5. **Extract title, text, author, date**
6. **Store to DB for querying/analyzing later**

If you want, I can write you a deep-research scraping prompt to find all GitHub repos, blog posts, and PDFs on "momentum strategy" using intelligent search+scrape. Want that?
