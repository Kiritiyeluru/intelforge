## Abstract

In this study, we leverage powerful non-linear machine learning methods to
identify the characteristics of trades that contain valuable information.
First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimized neural network
predictor in accurately predicting future market movements. Then, we utilize
the information from this successful neural network predictor to pinpoint the
individual trades within each data point (trading window) that had the most
impact on the optimized neural network's prediction of future price movements.
This approach helps us uncover important insights about the heterogeneity in
information content provided by trades of different sizes, venues, trading
contexts, and over time.
