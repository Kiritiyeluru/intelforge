## Abstract

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has experienced significant advancement over the
past decade, prompting a growing interest in applications within finance. This
survey critically evaluates 167 publications, exploring diverse RL applications
and frameworks in finance. Financial markets, marked by their complexity,
multi-agent nature, information asymmetry, and inherent randomness, serve as an
intriguing test-bed for RL. Traditional finance offers certain solutions, and
RL advances these with a more dynamic approach, incorporating machine learning
methods, including transfer learning, meta-learning, and multi-agent solutions.
This survey dissects key RL components through the lens of Quantitative
Finance. We uncover emerging themes, propose areas for future research, and
critique the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods.
