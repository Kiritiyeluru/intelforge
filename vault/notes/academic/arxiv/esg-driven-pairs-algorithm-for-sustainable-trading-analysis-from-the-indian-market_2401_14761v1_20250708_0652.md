## Abstract

This paper proposes an algorithmic trading framework integrating
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings with a pairs trading
strategy. It addresses the demand for socially responsible investment solutions
by developing a unique algorithm blending ESG data with methods for identifying
co-integrated stocks. This allows selecting profitable pairs adhering to ESG
principles. Further, it incorporates technical indicators for optimal trade
execution within this sustainability framework. Extensive back-testing provides
evidence of the model's effectiveness, consistently generating positive returns
exceeding conventional pairs trading strategies, while upholding ESG
principles. This paves the way for a transformative approach to algorithmic
trading, offering insights for investors, policymakers, and academics.
