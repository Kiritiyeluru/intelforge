## Abstract

Financial regulatory agencies are struggling to manage the systemic risks
attributed to negative economic shocks. Preventive interventions are prominent
to eliminate the risks and help to build a more resilient financial system.
Although tremendous efforts have been made to measure multi-risk severity
levels, understand the contagion behaviors and other risk management problems,
there still lacks a theoretical framework revealing what and how regulatory
intervention measurements can mitigate systemic risk. Here we demonstrate
regshock, a practical visual analytical approach to support the exploration and
evaluation of financial regulation measurements. We propose risk-island, an
unprecedented risk-centered visualization algorithm to help uncover the risk
patterns while preserving the topology of financial networks. We further
propose regshock, a novel visual exploration and assessment approach based on
the simulation-intervention-evaluation analysis loop, to provide a heuristic
surgical intervention capability for systemic risk mitigation. We evaluate our
approach through extensive case studies and expert reviews. To our knowledge,
this is the first practical systemic method for the financial network
intervention and risk mitigation problem; our validated approach potentially
improves the risk management and control capabilities of financial experts.
