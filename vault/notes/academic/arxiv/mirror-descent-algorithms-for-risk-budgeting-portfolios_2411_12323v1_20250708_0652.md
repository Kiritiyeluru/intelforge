## Abstract

This paper introduces and examines numerical approximation schemes for
computing risk budgeting portfolios associated to positive homogeneous and
sub-additive risk measures. We employ Mirror Descent algorithms to determine
the optimal risk budgeting weights in both deterministic and stochastic
settings, establishing convergence along with an explicit non-asymptotic
quantitative rate for the averaged algorithm. A comprehensive numerical
analysis follows, illustrating our theoretical findings across various risk
measures -- including standard deviation, Expected Shortfall, deviation
measures, and Variantiles -- and comparing the performance with that of the
standard stochastic gradient descent method recently proposed in the
literature.
