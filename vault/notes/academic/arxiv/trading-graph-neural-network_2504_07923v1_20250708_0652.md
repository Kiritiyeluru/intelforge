## Abstract

This paper proposes a new algorithm -- Trading Graph Neural Network (TGNN)
that can structurally estimate the impact of asset features, dealer features
and relationship features on asset prices in trading networks. It combines the
strength of the traditional simulated method of moments (SMM) and recent
machine learning techniques -- Graph Neural Network (GNN). It outperforms
existing reduced-form methods with network centrality measures in prediction
accuracy. The method can be used on networks with any structure, allowing for
heterogeneity among both traders and assets.
