# How to download intraday stock data for free in Python (tutorial + source code)

I've been using Yahoo Finance for most of my historical data. The API is quite generous for a free service, and surprisingly, it's possible to download a decent amount of intraday data for free (the lower the timeframe, the less data you're allowed).

Those who are just getting started with algo trading might be struggling to find a free data source, so I've made a tutorial video showing how to code this "data downloader", how to configure the various options, and how to download bulk data for multiple stocks at once.

**Video:** [Click here](https://youtu.be/5cZJPvEYRbA)  
**Code:** [GitHub link](https://github.com/russs123/algo_tutorials/blob/main/fetch_data_yf_tutorial.ipynb)

Let me know what you think.

Yahoo intraday data has lots of false prices that never has been! Also it has holes (no data at all) for 2 minutes during any day even for SPY!
