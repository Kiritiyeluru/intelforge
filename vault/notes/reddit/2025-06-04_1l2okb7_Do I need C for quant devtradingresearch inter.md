# Do I need C++ for quant dev/trading/research interviews or can I use Python?

Do employers favor one over the other?

The job description should clearly state what knowledge or skills are expected of you.

imo I wouldnt say NEED unless ur aiming for hft, then ur gonna need to know c++ like 100%. But, if you want to go more into like backtesting, prediction models, and other stuff, then c++ isnt required just good/preferable to have.

I'm not sure where they fit into, but I'm mainly eyeing top hedge funds and prop trading firms like Citadel/Two Sigma/Millennium/Jane Street

Most devs I’ve worked with in HFT were comfortable in C/C++/Python. An understanding and ability to work with assembly helps as well. That’s for people working directly on the code responsible for trading. There are plenty of people working on just python apps typically for clearing/logging and telemetry/dashboards and whatnot.
