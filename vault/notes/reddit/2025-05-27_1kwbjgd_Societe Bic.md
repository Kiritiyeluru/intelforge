Societe Bic looks too cheap for a good quality business that’s a household name with huge “mindshare” in its industries - pens, lighters, and razors. The company has a long history of innovation in common household products, and has a competitive advantage in its distribution network, which gets its products into all major consumer outlets throughout North America, Europe, and South America. 
 
It’s trading at an EV/FCF of 8, trailing EV/EBIT of 7.1, forward EV/EBIT of 6.9, which is a big discount to comparable consumer staples in the U.S. like Edgewell Personal Care and Newell Brands, and a discount to European staples like Unilever. 
 
The stock price has gradually drifted downwards as the razor segment saw competition from DTC competitors like Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s, worries over the long term decline in cigarette smoking, and general malaise in European equity markets. The threat of tariffs have now pushed the stock price even lower and I think this provides a good entry point. 
 
Bic is entering the hairbrush market with an acquisition of an innovative product Tangle Teezer, which has similar corporate culture of making a quality household consumer product but lacked the distribution network to grow the brand as quickly as they wanted. This might be a risk as it’s outside its core competency, but might also add higher margin sales and it’s been growing at a nice 10% clip, helping to inflect growth upward.  
 
The business is divided into 3 segments “human expression” (mostly pens, 37% of sales), “flame for life” (lighters, 37% of sales), and “blade excellence” (razors, 25% of sales). 
 
The pen business is the oldest and was started after Marcel Bich bought the patent to the ballpoint pen and made the first Bic crystal pen in 1950. Since then, they have continued to innovate in pens, and acquire adjacent businesses, like Wite-Out and Cello. Competitors include businesses like Sharpie and Paper Mate (owned by Newell), Staedtler (private), and Japanese companies like Pilot and Uni-ball (owned by Mitsubishi Pencil). 
 
Pens is a competitive business, but Bic has a strong reputation for the cheapest products that actually write and never fail. I work in healthcare and prefer Uni-ball for note taking but I’ve had some pen failures which are frustrating. I can’t honestly ever recall a time when a Bic crystal didn’t work for me or busted in my pocket. 
 
They added a temporary tattoo business Tattly and another Inkbox to the human expression segment, which is a bit dicey in my opinion, but the argument is that there is significant crossover in the core market for children and back to school shopping. The company recently took an asset writedown on Inkbox due to poorer than expected performance. I hope the company has learned its lesson that fads like temporary tattoos can’t match the long term power of a good consumer product but bad acquisitions remain a key risk. 
 
Bic added lighters in 1973 with the first bic lighter and had just dominated the segment, with over 50% market share of lighters globally today, and over 65% of market share in lighters in the U.S. To me, the lighter business is the crown jewel and after decades of building trust and reliability, they have a significant quality advantage over any other lighter brand. I think if Bic charged me twice as much for a lighter I wouldn’t switch. 
 
Bic has continued to innovate in lighters, introducing the first utility lighter in 1998, and added innovative products like pocket utility lighters in 2020, and the EZ load utility lighter in 2024, which can be reloaded with an ordinary Bic lighter. 
 
There has been a lot of investor concern that cigarette smoking is in decline and thus lighter sales will decline. The U.S. lighter segment was down 12% in 2024 which the company explained with weakness in consumer spending (unclear to me as overall PCE did not decline in 2024) and continued trends of decreasing cigarette smoking. 
 
But interestingly, during 2024, despite the sales slowdown, Bic actually GAINED market share, increasing by 0.2%. I find it is increasingly common to see convenience stores stocking nothing but Bic lighters. I feel like a business that can grow share in a down market is a particularly strong business, and it makes the market even more difficult to enter. 
 
Moreover cigarette smoking has continued to decline in the share of lighter use cases, helped by the addition of utility lighters. In the U.S., the largest use case for lighters (34% of lighter use) is now in candles and incense. The corporate presentations don’t break out cannabis use as a use case, but I’d also wager that cannabis use offsets some of the declines in cigarette use in lighter use cases, at least in the United States. In South America, the dominant use case is barbecue and stove top use, with over 50% of use cases for cooking and stoves. 
 
The razor business has always been tough with entrenched competitors Gillette and Schick. Bic entered the market in 1975 with the first disposable razor. Bic has always positioned itself within razors as affordable, accessible, and disposable. Gillette has a strong presence within female razor purchases, but Bic has been a strong competitor with its Soleil brand. 
 
The razor business was challenged in recent years with new entrants like Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s undermining a core competitive strength of distribution and targeting the very strength of the Bic razor offering - affordable, disposable razors. However Dollar Shave Club has floundered under Unilever management and has lost its initial “viral” buzz. Harry’s is a major competitor in razors now but mostly targets men and is priced higher than Bic’s segment of the razor market. Bic still has a niche in cheap, disposable razors targeted to women. 
 
The razor business is roughly 50% Gillette, Harry’s and Schick duking it out for second place, and Bic and Dollar Shave club with about 5-10% of market share respectively. 
 
The razor business is also the most vulnerable to tariffs, as the majority of the razors are manufactured in Greece. Tariffs could be a real risk because Bics core competitive strength is a quality razor for the lowest possible price. Corporate presentations show that Bic razors are the cheapest razor available at Wal-Mart aside from Wal-Mart’s own Equate brand, which I would argue is not considered a quality product. 
 
Tangle Teezer is a recent acquisition, and I am still undecided if it is overall a positive or negative. They bought the business for €200 million, and it has €70 million of sales growing 10% per year. Tangle Teezer is priced at a premium to other hairbrushes as it uses patent-protected 2-tiered flexible teeth to minimize tugging, pulling, and breaking tangled hair. Many users like the ability to detangle without breaking hair or causing pain, but there have been reports it is not as good on fine or thin hair. 
 
The company has primarily marketed through DTC channels and DTC is still 50% of sales, but it has been making inroads into distribution into stores. Part of the rationale for Bic’s acquisition is to leverage its strengths in distribution to get Tangle Teezer into all the stores where Bic is sold to grow the company faster.  
 
Furthermore, the higher priced product (with low cost to manufacture) means Tangle Teezer is accretive to margins at Bic. 
 
I am a bit worried as hairbrushes are outside of Bic’s core competencies, however the company has justified it as having a like minded consumer culture. The culture at Bic has always been to innovate on quality consumer products into household goods, so they argue Tangle Teezer is a good fit on culture. 
 
Management and corporate governance is a bit of a question mark at this point. Bic has had 3 generations of CEOs from the Bich family, and the family still controls 60% of the shareholder vote. Gonzales Bich has announced his intention to step down at the end of this year and the company has begun a search for an outside CEO. Empirical studies find that family controlled firms that bring in outside CEOs tend to perform better than those that stay in family control, because of the theory that drawing from a “larger pool” of talent brings in better management. We will see who gets chosen at the end of 2025. In the meantime, the Bich family still controls the board and can ensure that the founding culture of innovation in household products is maintain. 
 
Tariffs are a significant concern. The geographic breakdown of sales is 37% North America, 32% Europe, and 19% Latam. There is a very small presence in Africa, Middle East, and Asia, with only 12% of sales combined. 
 
The company historically hasn’t done the best job at turning over inventory. Manufacturing is spread across the globe, and days inventory in the 180s generally runs a lot higher than competitors like Edgewell (historically at 90-100, ran up to 145 in preparation for tariffs), Newell (historically 80-90, now at 120), and Unilever (historically 40-50, now at 56). However this excess inventory might actually turn out to be an advantage in a tariff war, because the company can run down pre-tariff inventory (depending on where the inventory is stored) to avoid price hikes until the tariff situation is clarified. 
 
The company makes about 50% of its lighters in France, but it does do a portion of lighter manufacturing in the U.S., which gives it a toehold if they want to increase U.S. lighter production to avoid tariffs in the future. A huge portion of pens and stationary are made in Mexico and are USMCA compliant, so they are exempt from tariffs under USMCA. Razors are challenged as a significant portion are made in Greece which will be subject to whatever EU tariff is decided upon. 
 
The fact that 60-70% of sales are outside the U.S. does give it a fair amount of insulation from tariff impacts. Lighters are disproportionately US exposed, but the strong brand share in the U.S. gives it cover to hike prices to offset the tariffs in the U.S. 
 
Tangle Teezer is predominantly manufactured in the UK, which already has a tariff agreement with the U.S. 
 
The valuation versus comps like Newell, Edgewell, and Unilever is compelling. For reference, the following metrics:
 
Edgewell: 
LTM PE 15.9 
NTM PE 8.7 
EV/Sales 1.1 
ROA: 4.0% 
ROE 5.5%, historically mid single digits, despite debt/EBITDA of 3.8 
Trailing EV/EBIT 10.9 
Forward EV/EBIT 10.2
 
Newell: 
LTM PE: negative earnings 
NTM PE: 7.9 
EV/Sales: 1.0 
ROA: 2.8% 
ROE: not directly comparable due to negative equity from buybacks 
Trailing EV/EBIT: 14.8 
Forward EV/EBIT: 11.6 
 
Unilever: 
LTM PE: 26.7 
NTM PE: 18.5 
EV/Sales: 2.7 
ROA: 9.1% 
ROE: 29% 
Trailing EV/EBIT: 16.2 
Forward EV/EBIT: 14.7 
 
For completeness, I’ll also put down some metrics for Pilot and Mitsubishi Pencil, but FWIW I also think these are too cheap mainly because they are Japanese.
 
Pilot 
LTM PE: 10.7 
NTM PE: unavailable 
EV/Sales: 0.85 
ROA: 7.1% 
ROE: 10.5% 
LTM EV/EBIT: 6.0 
Forward EV/EBIT: 6.2 
 
Mitsubishi Pencil (owner of Uni Ball) 
LTM PE: 11.0 
NTM PE: unavailable  
EV/Sales: 1.0 
ROA: 4.3% 
ROE: 8.7% 
LTM EV/EBIT: 8.3 
Forward EV/EBIT: 7.1 
 
Societe Bic actually looks much cheaper when looking at cash flow than earnings or EBIT metrics. The company aggressively depreciates assets and recently had an asset write down of its Inkbox acquisition which distorts the earnings picture. Depreciation and amortization has consistently run €20-30 million over capex since about 2019 or so. The company may have to do some capex if it decides to build out more U.S. manufacturing. 
 
The company focuses on FCF generation as a key metric, which is something I look for as a shareholder. The company has €280 million trailing FCF and forecasts at least €250 million FCF this year. This puts it at a trailing P/FCF of 8.6x and a forward P/FCF of at least 9.5. It also means you earn a 10% “cash flow yield” at these prices. The EV/FCF is a bit lower as the company has net cash on its balance sheet (unlike most comps in the sector, which typically have high debt loads). 
 
The company pays out a 5.3% dividend (useless to me as an American investor but maybe useful to European investors) and aims to pay out 40-50% of EPS each year as a dividend. The company has a plan to buyback €40 million per year, which I hope gets ramped up. 
 
The company also seeks to do an acquisition about every other year. Historically, most of Bic’s acquisitions have been pretty good, in directly adjacent businesses like stationary businesses, pen companies like Cello, and lighter companies. The temporary tattoo acquisition was a notable misstep. Tangle Teezer was too recent (2024) to tell if it will work out or not, but the rationale of culture fit and distribution access makes a lot more sense to me as an investor. 
 
I think overall, it’s a business that is pretty decent, with a highly defensible “crown jewel” in the lighter business, and ought to rerate to a mid-teens multiple on an EV/EBIT basis like other consumer staple companies. It’s got better return on capital metrics than companies like Edgewell and Newell yet trades at a much lower multiple. A 13x EV/EBIT multiple would put the share price at €100, which would be a 73% return from current prices. 
 
At this multiple it’s hard for me to see too much downside from current prices, and especially if you are a European investor exempt from U.S. dividend tax laws, you get paid a nice dividend to wait for a rerating. 
 
The balance sheet is also significantly underlevered versus many consumer staple businesses and there’s an opportunity for an outside CEO to ramp up buybacks by taking on a bit of leverage, which would goose the ROE and push prices higher. An increase in the buyback program would also mitigate the risks of further declines in the stock price. 
 
Key risks:
Management change from the Bich family
Corporate governance risks of family control
Cigarette smoking in decline
Competition in razors
Tariff threat, particularly in razors
Bad acquisitions

Good job. The only thing is that you could have written in your report almost any time in the past five years. The only major difference would be the Tangle Teezer acquisition. So the question is why the business has not performed well and the stock has basically done nothing in the past 5 years. In addition based on the current forecast, pretty much all business indicators are moving down, including FCF which is likely to be down to €200 m in 2025 and be range bound in the next few years. Is this a dying business that can be milked for cash flow in the next few years?
