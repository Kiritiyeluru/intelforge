# Am I on a Good Path for a Quant Internship Junior Summer

Hey, I’m a current rising sophomore at Penn (just finished my first year) studying CS, Math, and Stats as a Minor. I’m planning on recruiting for big tech/FAANG/F500 this fall, and quant + big tech my junior fall. This is my current trajectory; I’m curious if it’s good enough to get me past the resume screen.

Currently I have an internship experience at an AI startup + am currently interning at a CleanTech startup. I’m planning on leveraging this for a Big tech/F500/FAANG internship for next summer. I’ll be doing research in Algorithms or Machine Learning (still talking to PIs) throughout my Sophmore year. I’m also interning at a Fintech startup over the winter where I’ll be working on their investment algorithm (they’re essentially an app with their own algorithms to help people automate investing). Other than interview prep throughout sophmore year + applying to any of the insight programs / trading firm competitions I see throughout the next year, does this sound like it could get me past the resume screen for quant trader?

I’m not looking to apply for developer or research, but things change so who knows. I’m mainly nervous about not having related experiences as I don’t think I’m currently good enough at stats / optimization / etc to apply for small firms this year, and am taking certain courses to help me with these in the next 3 semesters [Analysis track -> Theory of Probability, Intro to Optimization, Machine Learning Course here at Penn, etc]. Thus I’m mainly just trying to get a big name like Amazon or google on my resume to try helping.

You’re not not on track

I got into the Interview process of Jane Street just through academic achievements, i think the quant Firms are more impressed by academics than work experience (except if you were an intern at another Quant firm)

This is a reasonable structure yes

It’s really not hard to get past the screen for these. It’s scoring in the top percentile vs 1,000 other geniuses for the initial math/tech assessment that you should be focused on

Do you mind me asking what kind of Academic achievements? Are you talking professor with tens of publications or graduate with a few? I just finished a Ph.D in mathematics (not an amazing school but top 40). Published two really good papers within the last two years. Getting zero interviews. I practiced a lot of quant questions/leetcode but can't seem to get an interview rendering these skills useless.

Doesn't everyone? This is a relevant meteocratic industry where it's reasonably easy to get into the pipeline.
