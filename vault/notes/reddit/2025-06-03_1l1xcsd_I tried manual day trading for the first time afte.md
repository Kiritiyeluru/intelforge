# I tried manual day trading for the first time after years of successful algo trading, and it was an epic fail. Anyone else have no idea how to manually trade.

I've been trading algorithmically, profitably since 2022.  My side strategies are swing but by far my main strategy is a day trading slow HFT (10 ms timeframe ) I run on Rithmic. I've been trying to run a second instrument on rhythmic, but it's not built for that.  You either can create a new account, and maintain separate fees and a separate bank account for each strategy, or you can deal with really heavy C++ programing, which was difficult for me.  But I figure before I give up and pay an extra to $1,200 a year to run a separate instrument, I'm going to try and program it. 

After a couple weekends programming, I tried to run it live this morning, epic fail, crashed after attempting the first trade.  I'm not a programmer. 

I'm not a manual trader either, I've never done it, I know the different types of trades, and methods of trading, but reading charts and making decisions is not my thing. 

But after my program crashed, I'm not sure what motivated me, I had the day off from work., So I said I would take the dive and trade exactly like my code but on a higher time frame.  I had no idea how to use R traders interface, but googling helped. 

But man all I saw were lines and bars going up and down, my strategy is mean reversion, so when the market moved up really fast, I went short.

Then the market kept on going up, I figure I'd wait a bit.  Then it went up really really fast, I figured if it's going up that fast it's going to come back down fast.  And it did, got me to just about break even, and I figured I'd get out after I make a little bit of profit.  And it went back up, and back up, and back up.  Kept on saying if it drops down a little bit I'll get out, it did not.  Then I could not figure out how to exit my positions.  My worst trading day ever.

According to the IRS, I am a a professional day trader. Lol but I'm really not!

Curious OP if you are not a programmer how did you setup algo trading?

I don't believe that it is appropriate to say that you can't manually trade. The problem that you are having is translating the algorithm into a manual supposition. 

Realistically, you should use two different accounts in the case of just learning to manual trade from scratch. I say learning to trade manually because ironically, it is an entirely different skill set than algorithmic trading. Go back to the basics with a demo account and start there.

Yes same. Except I'm not a successful algo trader either. I guess trading isn't for me.

Yes, 100% absolutely amen. I watch the charts and come up with new ideas all the time - but my human execution is so sloppy and prone to fomo. It's never more clear than when I "help the bot" by closing a trade early or jumping back in a trade after an early bot exit.

I have been algorithmic trading for 9 years, and I can go through the whole workflow of idea to backtest to live to scaling it, to create/implement profitable strategies, but I have never manually traded, don't know how to start, or what to look at to even make a decision.

Trading manually vs trading algorithmically requires different skillsets, so that's completely normal. All it matters is that you are profitable, whether it's manual or automated.

You are a professional day trader. 

Just because you don't *manually* click buy or sell, doesn't mean you aren't buying and selling.
