# Australian Student Looking for Resume Optimisations

https://preview.redd.it/1yoenagl6s4f1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b1e32309991adae6c7968236cc5cfb49f8a6594

I'm a second year in Australia looking to crack into some pre-pen programs and hopefully soon after some internships for quant firms in Australia and Asia. Wondering if I could get any feedback/advice on my resume, both low level (resume syntax/strategy I should be mindful for) and high level (things to focus on big picture moving forward to try stand out). Pretty new to this so any advice is really appreciated.

  
Thanks in advance.

What you should do is



D/dx (resume(x*)) =0


And solve for x*


Check that f"(resume(x*)) <0

Thanks for pointing this out. I switched degrees from a combined degree to juts an engineering degree and some of the units carried over. Also 2025-2027 is 3 years not 2!

You asked for resume optimization. So I told you how to check first order conditions. 


The resume format is fine. But content is what matters. There isnt much to optimize.
