## Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding, generation, and reasoning, yet their potential in
finance remains underexplored due to the complexity and specialization of
financial knowledge. In this work, we report the development of the
Baichuan4-Finance series, including a comprehensive suite of foundational
Baichuan4-Finance-Base and an aligned language model Baichuan4-Finance, which
are built upon Baichuan4-Turbo base model and tailored for finance domain.
Firstly, we have dedicated significant effort to building a detailed pipeline
for improving data quality. Moreover, in the continual pre-training phase, we
propose a novel domain self-constraint training strategy, which enables
Baichuan4-Finance-Base to acquire financial knowledge without losing general
capabilities. After Supervised Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback and AI Feedback, the chat model Baichuan4-Finance is able to
tackle various financial certification questions and real-world scenario
applications. We evaluate Baichuan4-Finance on many widely used general
datasets and two holistic financial benchmarks. The evaluation results show
that Baichuan4-Finance-Base surpasses almost all competitive baselines on
financial tasks by significant margins without sacrificing performance on
general LLM benchmarks. At the same time, Baichuan4-Finance demonstrates even
more impressive performance on financial application scenarios, showcasing its
potential to foster community innovation in the financial LLM field.
