## Abstract

In recent years, machine learning models have achieved great success at the
expense of highly complex black-box structures. By using axiomatic attribution
methods, we can fairly allocate the contributions of each feature, thus
allowing us to interpret the model predictions. In high-risk sectors such as
finance, risk is just as important as mean predictions. Throughout this work,
we address the following risk attribution problem: how to fairly allocate the
risk given a model with data? We demonstrate with analysis and empirical
examples that risk can be well allocated by extending the Shapley value
framework.
