## Abstract

In contrast to the rapid integration of the world economy, many regional
trade agreements (RTAs) have also emerged since the early 1990s. This seeming
contradiction has encouraged scholars and policy makers to explore the true
effects of RTAs, including both regional and global trade relationships. This
paper defines synthesized trade resistance and decomposes it into natural and
artificial factors. Here, we separate the influence of geographical distance,
economic volume, overall increases in transportation and labor costs and use
the expectation maximization algorithm to optimize the parameters and quantify
the trade purity indicator, which describes the true global trade environment
and relationships among countries. This indicates that although global and most
regional trade relations gradually deteriorated during the period 2007-2017,
RTAs generate trade relations among members, especially contributing to the
relative prosperity of EU and NAFTA countries. In addition, we apply the
network to reflect the purity of the trade relations among countries. The
effects of RTAs can be analyzed by comparing typical trade unions and trade
communities, which are presented using an empirical network structure. This
analysis shows that the community structure is quite consistent with some trade
unions, and the representative RTAs constitute the core structure of
international trade network. However, the role of trade unions has weakened,
and multilateral trade liberalization has accelerated in the past decade. This
means that more countries have recently tended to expand their trading partners
outside of these unions rather than limit their trading activities to RTAs.
