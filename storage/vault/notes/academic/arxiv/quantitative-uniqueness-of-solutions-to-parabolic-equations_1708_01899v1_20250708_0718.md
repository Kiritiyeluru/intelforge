## Abstract

We investigate the quantitative uniqueness of solutions to parabolic
equations with lower order terms on compact smooth manifolds. Quantitative
uniqueness is a quantitative form of strong unique continuation property. We
characterize quantitative uniqueness by the rate of vanishing. We can obtain
the vanishing order of solutions by $C^{1, 1}$ norm of the potential functions,
as well as the $L^\infty$ norm of the coefficient functions. Some quantitative
Carleman estimates and three cylinder inequalities are established.
