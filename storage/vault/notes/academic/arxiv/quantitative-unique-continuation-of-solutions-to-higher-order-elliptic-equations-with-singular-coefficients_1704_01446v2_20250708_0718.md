## Abstract

We investigate the quantitative unique continuation of solutions to higher
order elliptic equations with singular coefficients. Quantitative unique
continuation described by the vanishing order is a quantitative form of strong
unique continuation property. We characterize the vanishing order of solutions
for higher order elliptic equations in terms of the norms of coefficient
functions in their respective Lebesgue spaces. New versions of quantitative
Carleman estimates are established.
