Small Business Optimism, consumer credit data: What to Watch

Asking for a Trend host Josh Lipton outlines the top stories investors will be watching on Tuesday, July 8. Trade and tariffs will be watched closely after President Trump warned on Truth Social that some countries will be charged an additional 10% tariff. The June NFIB Small Business Optimism Index will be released, with economists expecting the number to hold relatively steady from May. Consumer credit data for May is also out tomorrow, with estimates of $10.5 billion — a sharp drop in borrowing from April's $17.9 billion. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend here.
