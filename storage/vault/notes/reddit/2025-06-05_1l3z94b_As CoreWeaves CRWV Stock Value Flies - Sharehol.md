# As CoreWeave's (CRWV) Stock Value Flies - Shareholders Increasingly Turn to Nebius (NBIS) in Shifting AI Cloud Landscape

The AI infrastructure market is experiencing rapid shifts, and recent developments suggest a potential re-evaluation by investors, with some CoreWeave shareholders reportedly looking towards Nebius as a more compelling opportunity.

While CoreWeave has seen significant stock surges and secured major deals, concerns about its profitability, customer concentration, and unique relationship with Nvidia appear to be prompting some investors to explore alternatives.

CoreWeave, a prominent AI hyperscaler, has undeniably made headlines. Following its IPO in late March 2025 at $40 per share, the company's stock has seen a meteoric rise, at one point surging over 200%. This impressive performance has been fueled by substantial infrastructure agreements, including an $11.2 billion revenue backlog with OpenAI, and continued strong demand for its purpose-built AI platform. Nvidia, a key investor and partner, also recently disclosed a 7% stake in CoreWeave, further boosting investor confidence.

However, a closer look reveals some underlying concerns that may be driving a shift in investor sentiment. Analysts have highlighted CoreWeave's reliance on a limited number of customers, with Microsoft alone accounting for approximately 72% of its revenue in Q1 2025. This customer concentration presents a significant risk, particularly as hyperscalers like Microsoft and Google continue to build out their own AI infrastructure. Furthermore, despite its high revenue growth, CoreWeave reported a net loss of $314.6 million in Q1 2025, raising questions about its path to profitability. The company is also heavily burdened by debt, with some estimates suggesting interest payments could balloon to over $2 billion annually.

Enter Nebius, a rising force in the AI cloud space. Nebius has swiftly positioned itself as a serious contender, focusing on building a global footprint with data centers in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Like CoreWeave, Nebius also boasts a strong partnership with Nvidia, being a launch partner for NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra AI Factory Platform.

What makes Nebius particularly attractive to some investors is its strategic approach to growth and financing. In December 2024, Nebius secured $700 million in equity funding from investors including Accel and Nvidia, followed by a recent $1 billion debt financing round in June 2025. The company's unique financial position, leveraging ownership and equity stakes in non-core businesses like Toloka and ClickHouse, allows it to fund its aggressive expansion plans for its core AI infrastructure business. Nebius has also been actively expanding its data center capacity, recently adding three new regions, including a strategic data center in Israel.

While both CoreWeave and Nebius are aggressively scaling to meet the surging demand for AI infrastructure, Nebius appears to be gaining traction due to its diversified funding strategy, expanding global reach, and potentially more stable long-term outlook. As the AI cloud market continues to evolve, the ability to rapidly deploy capacity, diversify customer bases, and maintain a sound financial footing will be crucial for sustained success. The reported pivot of some CoreWeave shareholders towards Nebius underscores a growing recognition among investors that while immediate growth is appealing, sustainable profitability and strategic diversification are paramount in this fiercely competitive sector.
