# To stock market veterans. What’s the Smartest decision you ever made?


As investors, we make countless decisions simple ones like “buy or don’t buy,” to really tough ones like holding a stock through a market crash.

If you’ve been investing for a long time, you’ve probably had your share of both great and terrible calls.

What’s the best investment decision you’ve ever made? What about the worst?

And how did those decisions turn out for you in the long run?

At orientation 25 years ago, listening to that HR person who told me to "just put an X on that".

    [x] Contribute to company 401k

I was new to the country and didn't even know what a 401k was. Sits at 700k now.

Ignore everything. Don’t time the market. Just keep buying.

Start young. Buy regularly,
In good times and in bad. Invest in low cost index funds. I’m personally a big S&P 500 guy.

I lived through the Dot-Com crash, the housing/financial crisis of 2008, and Covid. Came out smelling like a rose by only doing the above. Nothing fancy.
I am the world’s laziest investor and this advice set me for early retirement.

Best decision i ever made was investing not trading. This seems to be the complete opposite of what reddit does. If you simply consistently buy the market the ups and downs are completely irrelevant.

Best one is just keep investing and don't stop.

When there's a market panic (like Trump trade war few months ago), I bought a lot!
