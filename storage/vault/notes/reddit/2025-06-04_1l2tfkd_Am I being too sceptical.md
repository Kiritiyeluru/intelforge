# Am I being too sceptical?

A few years ago I made a couple crypto trading bots and came to the conclusion that it's not possible to be predictably profitable unless you follow and predict the news.

One of the people I have been doing some labour work for told me that he has been working on a trading strategy on us30 for 2 years now and he has been following it for 8 months making profit, but doesn't have enough time to sit at the computer all day because he has a business to run. He wants me to code him a bot that follows this strategy but I just can't imagine an algorithmic strategy being reliable with no human input based on sentiment and news.

It's a strategy that uses different moving average techniques and liquidity.

What do you guys think? Would relearning how to make this be a waste of time in my already busy life? The main reason why I am so cautious is because the payment for developing it is the strategy itself which he showed me. If that's the case if it's not profitable I will have wasted my valuble time lol

Depends in part on the horizon, but the number of professional firms printing money without sentiment is indisputable evidence against your point of view.

Hi, you should ask ChatGPT to explain the basics of "quantitative finance" as it pertains to trading, because you absolutely do not have to follow or predict the news, and there are firms making billions of dollars annually who don't give a fuck about the news or sentiment analysis.

Your conclusion is false.

What I would do in your shoes is to ask him to analyze a trading opportunity in a screen recording or on a call. Then think critically through if this is possible to instruct a program to do the exact same, or if there are any discretionary parts to trading this.

As well as ask him to prove the live performance through a account statement from his broker

I would only work for money, not his strategy. There are lots of entities that are profitable using algorithmic trading, but if your potential client isn't one of them, then your "payment" will actually be less than zero because of the time that you put into it. If his strategy is worth a damn, he should have at least earned enough in trading profits that he can afford to pay you with real money, not a non-proven pipe dream. Think about it from his point of view: if it's a piece of shit strategy (which in all likelihood it is), then he gets away with having a sucker create the code for him and he's lost nothing. The other possibility is that he's going to you code it for him, but in reality he's just showing you a shit version of his REAL strategy, and after you code it for him, you'll be stuck with the garbage strategy and he'll just make the necessary tweaks to trade his REAL strategy. Don't walk....run away.

This is a rule in life, in general. If you believe it won’t work then you are right. If you believe it will work then you are right also.

You might be throwing in the towel too early. Why don’t you experiment with data, test as many hypotheses as possible, then make a conclusion?

Firms are making money for sure. They have the best engineers, and math minds in the world. Question is how good do you have to be to get a small slice of the alpha. Based on my experience you have to do all the basics that this sub will tell you—backtest, data pipeline prep, backtest three times, optimize, forward test. if all that works out you have a viable ATS that may work in a paper trading and then finally live. If it doesn’t work then you’re back to square one.

You could probably test his strategy in python before writing it into an actual bot. It might be a weekend of coding to find out.

Does the strategy work on real trades (not demo)? I say we all chip in and build out the strategy! Count me in! Developers unite!!
