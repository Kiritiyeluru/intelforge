# Trade execution app for Alpaca

Any suggestions for a manual execution and option trading app that can be connected to Alpaca? If such a thing even exists. For example, I like the IBKR app for execution on mobile. I guess anybody could just build their own app by using the alpaca API, but I am wondering if something already exists.

The default alpaca trade browser UI is very clunky, and it's hard to make mid-prices, switch between instruments, and edit orders. This is for trading options primarily.

I don't have an answer for you, as I don't think I've seen any platforms with Alpaca support, but I'm curious why you're using Alpaca if not for their API? That's their whole thing.
