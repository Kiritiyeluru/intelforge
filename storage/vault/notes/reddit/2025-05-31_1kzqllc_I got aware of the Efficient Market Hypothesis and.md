# I got aware of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and the Random walk theory, I wanted to ask: Are you guys really beating the market with algotrading and do you work in an organisation or individual?

the EMH and RWT left me so pessimistic, I don't really know what to do but aside that vent, how are you guys doing since you've started algotrading?

The Grossman-Stiglitz Paradox argues that if the EMH is true then all information are already contained in the prices, so there would be no possible way to find new information that could generate excess profit, so there would not be any incentive to trade on new information, so prices would not reflect new information, therefore prices do not contain all available information, so the EMH is false.

Been reading Burton Malkiel have you?

It's true that candlestick patterns are complete bullshit, but a truly efficient market would be violation of the laws of physics since we cannot have instant and perfect dissemination of information.  Another term for "chop" is "price discovery", after all.

Similarly we observe real behaviors that are not in line with EMH like momentum.  

All that to say, yes you can make money, but not by looking at the same "indicators" or chart patterns that every other retail traders is looking at.  Use math and statistics, or just trend follow tbh.

Beating the market is easy if you have enough money and are of small size.  Buy SPY, sell a 12 month call.  Congratulations you beat the market.

Disclaimer: I am interplanetarily high right now and this is financial advice.

That shits bs, littered with fallacies. Go read Robert Carver's advanced futures trading book. Show you how easy it is.

As I understand, EMH basically states youâ€™re not gonna find a random $50 bill on the street because somebody would have already taken it. With seems paradoxical to me, because it means somebody did find the $50 bill.

Before being "aware of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and the Random Walk Theory," I recommend that you investigate the difference between a theory, a hypothesis, and a law.

There's a reason neither of these are considered laws in economics. 

For starters, if the efficient market hypothesis holds true for the stock market, then stock prices are explainable and, therefore, not random. Random walks are also testable. There are multiple papers and books that dig into the math. (Look for the econometrics papers, not the quantitative finance ones.) The math doesn't support the random walk theory enough to elevate it to a law.

Personally, I think Pilkington's right. The efficient market hypothesis is a tautology, not a hypothesis. If your explanation for every successful trader, hedge fund, and even Warren Buffet is "they got lucky but...", you don't have a falsifiable hypothesis, which means you don't really have a hypothesis. There is evidence that individual stocks can be more efficient than others (micro efficiency, not macro), but it's not perfect efficiency.

That brings me to the other thing that's not explained until you get further into this subject. Efficiency isn't a yes/no question. Even the original Fama paper proposed different categories based on how efficient a market is. Think of it more like a sliding scale. It also tends to go hand in hand with assumptions about market conditions (like perfect competition) that do not necessarily exist.

See [Samuelson's Dictum and the Stock Market](http://www.econ.yale.edu//~shiller/pubs/p1183.pdf) for more on micro efficiency. (The references are worth reading, too.)

Edit: Since you asked... Low frequency algo trading with real money since 2002 with few regrets. I don't day trade. I generally automate the signal, not the trade itself. Long-term, I consistently beat the S&P 500 after fees and taxes. That's not the flex people think it is. Right now, treasury money markets are beating the S&P 500 year to date.

How do you think markets get to be efficient?

Some actor has to discount the novel news by trading on it.  If the market were 100% efficient, we'd see sawtooth waves in the market.    
  
EMH and RWT are models/simplifications of the market;  they make the mathematics tractable; as for how WELL they model the market, that's something up for debate.

Individual and one of my accounts is starting to pull ahead of all the indexes I track except for one (FTSE 250). My other account is lagging but I started scaling up at the market peak. I only started in October but the results are encouraging.

As for random walks... buying stocks on random days does actually work in my backtester. However it's not as profitable as my own strategies.

My understanding is that EMH is a perfect model of the imperfect world. Same with RWT, it's basically a model to describe how the price moves, which is far from reality. As a matter of fact, if market prices really followed a random walk, you could easily make money by buying options that are undervalued compared to the Black Scholes model, since that model assumes a random walk (among other assumptions). But that's not the case. So, the model is just a mathematical toy.

I think for the most part, in lower time frames, the market behaves more like a random walk (as stated in some good resources about market behavior). In the long term, the market behaves less of a random walk. You can see this by a consistent up trend in the general market. 

For EMH, this might impact retail traders the most. We don't have the latest information compared to politicians or executives. 

I think there are still areas where beating the market is possible for retailers like following politicians and mean reversion. We do have some advantages over bigger institutions who move the market.
