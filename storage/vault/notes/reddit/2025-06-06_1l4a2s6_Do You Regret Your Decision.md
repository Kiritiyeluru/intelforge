# Do You Regret Your Decision?

It's been about ~2 months since the market bottom from tariff fears. In early April, there were countless posts like "This is the end" & "I'm selling all of my stocks".

For those of you that sold or decided not to buy the dip, how do you feel? Genuinely, do you regret your decision? Or, do you still feel a future downturn in 2025/2026 is justified?

The only thing worse than letting randos on reddit dictate your finances is letting redditors motivated by political animus do it.

with all due respect, you are basically asking a question in a way that expects a certain answer. of course those who sold and didn't rebuy probably regret. the REAL question should be, "regardless how you approached the tariff cliff and recovery (thus far), do you feel you navigated this time well and what did you learn?" this allows answers such as:


* I sold and didn't buy - regret my decision.


* I sold and didn't buy as I am still concerned but i sleep well at night.


* I sold and bought back at a lower cost - I feel great.


* I held throughout and feel good about my choice.


* I held throughout but regret a missed opportunity.


you can have legitimate disucssions around that rephrased question. what you posted is just a low effort facade seemingly aimed at rubbing it in the faces of those who sold and missed the recovery.


(Note: I sold and rebought back at a lower cost - check my post history for proof)

We haven't really seen the effects of a recession or tariffs yet on earnings. It's way too early to say what's going on. People saying doom is near and bulls calling other people doomers are both jumping the gun. We won't know for a couple quarters.

They'll just tell you the end is still coming. They'll say this for years. Eventually, they'll be right.

I did nothing. I do not regret doing nothing.

No regrets.

Then again, it’s easy for me since I’m in my late 60’s and retired.

With interest rates normalized, I bounced out of 90+% of my equity positions before Inauguration Day.

I saw this movie in 2017. Didn’t like it then and therefore no reason to watch it again.

As long as Trump is in office the only thing we can be sure of is uncertainty. The market is assuming the adults left in gov’t make the tarriffs and his new debt expansion bill go away. I sure hope the market’s right.

I have been dollar cost averaging for over 20 years, every month.  It works for me.  Doesn’t get the immediate eye popping returns but it’s effective

You do realize we haven't pushed past the Feb. 21st price, right?

That was when macroeconomic data showed that consumer sentiment went off a cliff and the Services PMI showed contraction.

After that, it's been swings on the election, tweets of the day, on again off again trade deals.

Nothing has changed since Feb. 21st. It's just been a lot of noise.

Until that price is breached - and it's going to have to take positive macroeconomic news - nothing has changed in the market.

Earnings won't do it. NVDA's earnings BLEW THE DOORS OFF. It went up but then stalled out and fell.

Market breadth is at historically insane lows. The housing market is going to shit. VIX hasn't even kissed 15 in months.

If you want to make a case that people who sold off in April were dumb, fair enough.

If you want to make that case based on the fact that this momentum is going to continue then make the case.

No data shows that right now.
