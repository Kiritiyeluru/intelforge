# How do you backtest bonds?

I've been currently trying to gather resources and info on back testing a treasury bond strat , but I'm confused on how you would backtest a bond. I plan on using [backtest.py](http://backtest.py)  for back testing software and [yfinance.py](http://yfinance.py) for yield data but I'm confused on the next step on pricing the bonds as well as dealing with the coupon payments? The plan is to backtest treasury bonds using 13 week, 5 yr and 30 yr yield data from 2000 to 2024 while using logistic regression to predict the prob of yield rising/falling from the oldest available data to 1999?

the yield gives you the bond price already..

if you know the yield, then you know the bond price
