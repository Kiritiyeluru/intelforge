# IBRK Alternatives for Canadians?

Hi. The current strategy I am developing is at high risk of triggering IBRK's aggressive enforcement of rule 144, meaning I will be allowed to buy but then blocked from selling. While there are lots of brokerage API options available to other nationalities such as Americans, few allow Canadian customers. Have any Canadians found any alternatives and can confirm it works for them? So far I have come across Oanda which appears to accept Canadian customers and has an API, but I want to confirm if a Canadian can actually vouch that the API works for them. I'm also concerned that Oanda being a Market Maker will introduce latency, and I'm not sure if this will realistically have an impact on my scalping strategy.

My algorithm is currently implemented on QuantConnect. None of their other supported US equities brokers appear to accept Canadian customers (TradeStation, Alpaca, Charles Schwab, Tradier), but please correct me if I'm wrong. They have a link to request new brokerage support, which I will use if I can identify an alternative.

Why is it high risk of triggering that rule?
