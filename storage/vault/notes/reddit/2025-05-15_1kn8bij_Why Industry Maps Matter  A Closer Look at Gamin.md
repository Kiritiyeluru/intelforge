# Why Industry Maps Matter üó∫Ô∏è A Closer Look at Gaming üïπÔ∏è - Asking for Feedback

**tl;dr**

* I'm working on my newsletter and trying to level up the **visual content** around investing.
* I picked the **gaming industry** üïπÔ∏è‚Äî one of the stronger-performing megatrend pockets in the market.
* I've made a couple of **industry maps** üó∫Ô∏è to help make sense of it.
* Personally, I like the depth of **Map 1**, but I also created a **simpler version (Map 2)** for a quick overview.
* **I'd love your feedback** ‚Äî what's missing, what's overkill, what you'd change.
* I'm also thinking about a benchmarking slide deck: revenue growth, margins, ROIC, and shareholder returns.
* There's a ton of great content out there ‚Äî deep-dive writeups, podcasts, CEO interviews. I might curate the best stuff ‚Äî would that be useful?
* What else do you think would help retail or professional investors get a better grip on this space?
* I plan to cover other industries that benefit from secular tailwinds using the same framework, so I want to make sure it's actually useful and relevant.
* Full post below

# Why Industry Maps Matter üó∫Ô∏è A Closer Look at Gaming üïπÔ∏è

In our recent piece on **Q1 2025 thematic fund performance**, we noted that many megatrend themes stumbled. But one industry held up remarkably well: Gaming! üöÄ

The **VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF** (ticker: ESPO) delivered strong returns across both time horizons ‚Äî the challenging Q1 2025 and the broader 2022‚Äì2024 period.

Despite broader pressure on consumer sentiment and tech multiples, gaming showed resilience ‚Äî supported by strong brand IP, recurring revenues, and enduring demand for interactive entertainment. When a segment shows strength in two very different market environments, it often points to something deeper: a **secular growth story** worth understanding.

We want to understand this industry better ‚Äî how it works, where each company plays, and where the most investable opportunities lie. To do that, we want to built an **industry map**. How can we do this and what would be a good tool to do this methodically?

# What‚Äôs an Industry Map ‚Äî and Why Use One?

Think of an industry map as a **visual x-ray** of a market. It helps answer key questions like:

* What are the business models in this space?
* Where in the value chain does each player operate?
* Who is vertically integrated? Who‚Äôs focused on a niche?
* Where does the money flow?

One helpful way to frame it comes from [Michael Mauboussin and Dan Callahan in their excellent piece, ‚ÄúMeasuring the Moat‚Äù (Morgan Stanley):](https://www.morganstanley.com/im/publication/insights/articles/article_measuringthemoat.pdf)

>

They included an industry map for the U.S. airline industry ‚Äî which isn‚Äôt really driven by a secular growth trend ‚Äî and I also believe the visualization could be more informative. For instance, major players like airports are missing entirely. I think we can do better, and I‚Äôd love your feedback.

# A Better Use Case: Gaming Industry Map (Simplified)

Here‚Äôs a **simplified industry map** I built for the gaming sector.

[Link to PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GCiL2iRu1EQaMjzrct3AX6dNeozw_Yfw/view?usp=sharing)

This version captures the **core business models**. The logos indicate which companies are active in each field:

* **Nintendo** is a pure-play gaming company operating as a *Vertically Integrated Ecosystem*. It develops, publishes, owns the platform, and also sells the hardware ‚Äî most notably, the Nintendo Switch.
* The same is true for **Sony**, which owns the PlayStation ecosystem. However, the key difference lies on the right side of the table: Sony also generates significant revenue from *non-gaming* segments. So while its gaming business is structurally similar to Nintendo‚Äôs, it is **not** a pure play, also visible via the lower ‚ÄúMegatrend Exposure‚Äù.
* **Take-Two**, the company behind the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) franchise, is a pure-play *developer and publisher*. Its DNA is creating compelling gaming content, which is then monetized through platforms like Nintendo (Switch), Sony (PlayStation), or Microsoft (Xbox).
* **Logitech** and **Corsair** fall into the *hardware* category, providing physical gaming gear and accessories to players and streamers alike.
* You might know the saying, *‚ÄúDuring a gold rush, sell shovels.‚Äù* That‚Äôs exactly what **AppLovin** and **Unity** are doing. They are *infrastructure* plays ‚Äî enabling developers to monetize games via advertising tech, or supporting them with development tools and game engines.

You can immediately see **who plays where** and who may benefit most from digital trends, cross-platform IP, and rising monetization sophistication.

# Going Deeper: Gaming Value Chain Exposure

Here‚Äôs a more detailed version. This is how I would structure a market map for my own reference ‚Äî something I‚Äôd keep on my desk.

[Link to PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GcBWvY_HlFJFuIVHEGZcRpqQEV4_EW_S/view?usp=sharing)

The main differences include:

* Revenue breakdowns by segment
* A few examples of key products and services

# What Else Would Add Value?

I see this industry map as a first step toward identifying compelling stocks and segments within gaming. The natural next step, to me, is to dig into the financials and assess which parts of the industry are more profitable or growing faster than others. I‚Äôd be looking at:

* Long-term revenue growth patterns
* Differences in margin structures and return on capital profiles
* Whether this translates into superior shareholder returns

Such a **benchmarking deck** would help pinpoint which business models and companies are most attractive for long-term ownership.

Once you‚Äôve shortlisted the stocks to prioritize, you‚Äôll probably want to gather additional insights ‚Äî such as:

* Deep-dive investment cases
* Podcasts explaining the industry landscape
* Interviews with senior executives

Would a curated list of this kind of content be helpful?

# Please Let Me Know

* Is the simplified industry map too basic ‚Äî or just right? What would you add?
* Is the more detailed version too complex? How would you adjust it?
* Would a benchmarking slide deck be useful?
* Would a curated list of investment cases, podcasts, interviews, etc. be of interest?

Reply to this post or reach out directly. I'm thinking of adjusting the industry map a bit after your feedback, adding the benchmarking deck, but also layering in external research like investment cases, podcasts, and executive interviews.

The idea is that this format could easily be replicated for other thematic segments with strong secular tailwinds ‚Äî like semiconductors or defense stocks ‚Äî helping investors quickly understand who plays where, what drives value, and where to dig deeper.
