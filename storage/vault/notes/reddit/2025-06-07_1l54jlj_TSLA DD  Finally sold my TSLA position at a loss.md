# TSLA DD + Finally sold my TSLA position at a loss - looks like a very risky bet to hold

**TSLA Risks and Competition:**

* No EV subsidies going forward
* Elon has pissed off both left and right, the US Congress, and the rest of the world
* Elon has personally attacked a sitting president of the US
* Stock price is at absurd valuation, with declining customers and sales
* A [fatal Tesla FSD crash on video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvyLWywD400&t=1594s) shows limitations of camera-only autonomous driving
* Without LIDAR, their Robotaxis could be death machines on the road under challenging light conditions, if not remotely monitored/controlled, as the fatal crash video released by Bloomberg shows - scroll down for video: [https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-tesla-full-self-driving-crash](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-tesla-full-self-driving-crash)
* **Tesla Robotaxi Competition**: Other robotaxi companies that actually use LIDAR - [Pony.ai](http://Pony.ai) ($PONY), WeRide ($WRD), Waymo ($GOOG), Zoox ($AMZN) already have actual autonomous robotaxis on the roads. Look up their videos on X and YouTube
* **Tesla Optimus Competition**: Many US and Chinese companies are building advanced humanoid robots vs. Optimus. Here's a video of Figure AI humanoid robot: [https://x.com/PTrubey/status/1931018152424649149](https://x.com/PTrubey/status/1931018152424649149)
* Tesla’s Head of Optimus humanoid robot program is leaving the company: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-06/tesla-s-leader-of-optimus-humanoid-robot-program-leaves-company](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-06/tesla-s-leader-of-optimus-humanoid-robot-program-leaves-company)

DISCLAIMER:

* I do not have any position in TSLA beyond through an S&P500 index fund
* I sold my TSLA stock at a 6% loss yesterday after holding for a year. Might buy again if I see progress and if it dips below 225 (or maybe below 185)

EDIT: Clarification on last disclaimer - I bought TSLA about a year ago but bought some more in late 2024 which raised my average costs basis up by a lot

How did you hold for a year and sell for a 6% loss on a stock that is up 70% in the last year?

You would have had to buy in November or 2022.

'Elon has personally attacked a sitting president of the US'

This, generally, is not an issue in the USA. Yet, this is an issue in this USA.

1 trillion dollar valuation on 8 billion dollars of declining earnings screams “no thank you”

Hey, you didn’t lose—you paid tuition to the market like the rest of us

A sound risk-aversion choice. Tesla has a struggling at best business model with promises of 10x capabilities that are struggling to keep up with competitors. People are betting (gambling) on Musk’s track record because if he’s right the stock will be much more valuable. But if they’re wrong you’re going to see a P/E decline by 100-150 points depending on the day / volume of ketamine ingested. Another option is to leave 1-2% of your capital in Tesla as a Fuck it who knows bet.

DD for tesla is a futile exercise, it's never been coupled with fundamentals. Good for wheeling with all the volatility. That is until it gets put down for good. But who knows when that could be when price can be resurrected by a single tweet. It's vibes bro with this one.

This is a classic panic sell. You’re bringing up a bunch of arguments that existed a month ago, but you decided to sell after it crashed 20%? Why did you even still own it if this was your thesis?

These are the reasons I sold most of mine too...   Gonna be painful for the holders IMO
