# Investment Books that are worth ...the investment

I have been following this subreddit and r/dividends for a while and have a a few shares of SCHD, SPHD, FDRR, and WMT but I don't have a bunch of money, just been taking a few bucks every paycheck and buying a share here and there. I'm wondering if there is a good book that gives solid advice about better ways to invest for growth.

There are tons of videos online and I think warren buffet credits a book he read to help him early on but Im not sure if any of them are valid and want to find some real advice on wasy to make more money with stock. Day trading sounds like it's an intense and highly concentrated effort. I don't want to get lost into a YouTube mix of "do this to become rich". My end goal is to be able to look at my account in 1-2 years and possible use that money to pay for my cell phone bill $125 a month.

To make $125 a month I may need somewhere around 40k invested in dividend stocks to possibly generate that but is there a book that would give me a solid approach on growing what I currently have and turn %10 profit every year? Should I just find another rstrema of income and invest more and be patient or is there some code that I haven't cracked that could be learned in a book.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

TLDR: im looking to find solid knowledge to grow my stock account wisely and hopefully see returns with dividend stocks.

I highly recommend The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel, as the first thing any investor should read.

Then, after you've read that, some other books you might find helpful could include: The Investor's Manifesto, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing, Fail-Safe Investing, and One-Up On Wall Street. I would take a look at those, and see which you gravitate towards. But, you should definitely read The Psychology of Money, first.

Intelligent Investor isn't even in the top 5 books you should read.  It's like if somebody was interested in evolutionary biology, and you were recommend On the Origin of Species as the top read.  It's important for historical reasons.  It's not a good "how to get started invested with modern instruments like ETFs and indexed mutual funds" type book.

The Boglehead's Guides, Little Book of Common Sense Investing, Four Pillars of Investing, and Random Walk are all much better options.

Ben Graham's Intelligent Investor, followed by Security Analysis, should get you 90% of the way there.

I would also add https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividendirrelevance.asp to your reading list.

Peter Lynch's books are still excellent, and you don't need an MBA or CFA certification to follow the content. He was bit skeptical of academic thinking, anyway.

Joel Tillinghast wrote an excellent book called *Big Money Thinks Small* He was hired at Fidelity based on a recommendation from Lynch.

Nassim Taleb's books, not directly and entirely about investing but very relevant to investing.

"If You Can" is a free booklet and covers about 98% of investors.  And it takes less than an hour to read.

That will be $100 for consulting fee, thanks.

I really don't think you need to read Intelligent Investor.  I've read it twice and I think if you want to trade stocks its a great test of "do I got the "it" muscle to trade stocks".  (basically sound single stock investing requires learning to read a balance sheet, financial statements, etc a la Warren Buffett....i didnt' want to do that)

Random walk down wallstreet by burton malkiel is a great "tour" of the history of the market.
Where are all the customers yachts by Fred Schwed
One Up on wallstreet by Peter Lynch - guy was a workhorse trader one of the greatest.
Investor Manifesto - Bill Bernstein
Thinking Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahnamen
Common Sense Investing - Jack Bogle

These books really gave me a foundation is thinking about money, thinking about the markets, and thinking of how to tackle my money in the market.
