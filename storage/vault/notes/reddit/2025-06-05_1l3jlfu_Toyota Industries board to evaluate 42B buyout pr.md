# Toyota Industries board to evaluate $42B buyout proposal

https://www.perplexity.ai/page/toyota-industries-board-to-eva-urLtiFKiTmGmDSANwKDO_A


Toyota Industries Corp.‘s board is set to evaluate a ¥6.6 trillion ($42 billion) takeover bid from Toyota Motor Corp. and affiliates on June 3, 2025, potentially taking the company private. The move aims to strengthen Toyota Motor’s supply chain control amid pressures from Japan’s market regulator on corporate governance. Toyota Fudosan, Toyota Motor’s real estate arm, will launch a ¥180 billion ($1.26 billion) tender offer to streamline ownership and boost innovation in logistics and mobility. This follows Toyota Motor’s increased stake in Toyota Industries to 24.22% by March 2025. The privatization could enhance efficiency but raises concerns about reduced shareholder value and market transparency. Discussions also include addressing Toyota Industries’ cross-shareholdings to comply with Tokyo Stock Exchange rules. A decision is expected soon, with shares rising 2.7% in Tokyo trading.

Potentially privatizing what exactly? Toyota Motors, Industries, both?

$42B is massive even for Toyota. Interesting that they're doing this now with all the EV transition pressure probably want to streamline operations and cut costs before things get even more competitive

It seems like the board is looking to privatize all of it. I’m sure there’s convos about breaking it up. But I didn’t see that in the article.

Just industries, to eliminate awkward interconnectivity between the two public entities.

If Toyota's solid state battery moves into production it will be a game changer for EVs. 

It's been 3 years away for the last 10 years.

I.thought Toyota was focusing more on hybrids than pure EVs.  Did that change?

Toyota's one full EV here in the states is booming since Musk alienated his largest customer base. I live in a liberal city, and it's obvious people are buying them instead of Teslas in 2025. It's not anecdotal, seriously - I commute and went from seeing one a month to 2-3 a day. \*edit sorry my point is, Toyota's EV business is already doing well. I decided, since I'm a data scientist, that this anecdotal claim was absurd, so I checked Toyota's first quarter sales report - bZ4X sales up 200% rofl.

Those plugin hybrids of theirs are *great*. 

They're *basically* full EVs til you need to go out of town for a weekend or something.
