# Your opinion on Strategy Quant

Hello, I don't have much experience in this field, which is why I'm asking this question: what is your opinion on Strategy Quant?

Do you think it's possible to develop real strategies that generate profits?

Have you developed any strategies that you use from there?



Thank you all for reading (and responding).

It's good just be cautious, It's very easy to fall in over optimized with SQX If you don't have a solid optimization method

Strategy quant is actually quite good, if you construct the right custom workflows with relevant robustness checks.

I recommend it if you haven't tried it before.

Look at stat oasis on YouTube for tutorials.
