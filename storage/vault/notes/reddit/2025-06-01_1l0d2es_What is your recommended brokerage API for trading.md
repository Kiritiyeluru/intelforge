# What is your recommended brokerage API for trading futures? I want free realtime market data and low transaction fee.

I have been looking into this for a while.

IBKR: realtime data needs subscription unless your transaction fees in a month>some threshold?

Schwab: not support futures yet.

Ninja: subscription needed.

Tradestation: transaction fee in the previous month > 40.

I am also interested in trading stocks, forex and crypto.

1. Good
2. Free
3. Fast

You can only pick two.

Check out Architect maybe? Not sure on their cost structure, but they offer futures trading.

Lightspeed is another to look at.

You have enough money to buy large scale futures but not pay for market data? Almost no actual brokers give out free real time market data on futures and derivatives.

Have you checked out the [Architect Brokerage](https://architect.co)?

We integrate with TradingView in our web gui and we have native Rust/Python/Typescript APIs for algo trading with actually good documentation (a lot of the [Python API](https://github.com/architect-xyz/architect-py) was written by yours truly)!

We also currently have free data for futures and stocks.

As for our transaction [pricing](https://www.architect.co/brokerage/pricing), you can see that we offer straightforward and competitive pricing.

You should check us out! We're a relatively new brokerage with futures, equities, crypto. Founded by ex-Jane Streeters (and I'm from DRW), so we have deep experience with trading technology. Let me know if you have any questions!

Full Disclosure: I work at Architect

Have you ever looked at AMP with Rithmic? I have the feeling it offers quite good data and fast response times.
