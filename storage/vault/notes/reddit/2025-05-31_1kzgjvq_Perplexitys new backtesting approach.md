# Perplexitys new backtesting approach

Perplexity is getting into backtesting. Curious would anyone use this? Feels like tad overfitting but functionality seems good for beginners

Ok just tested Perplexity labs on various backtesting questions from simple things like max drawdown to simple 60/40 backtests, and I'm afraid Perplexity Labs is total garbage. It generates random code on the fly to compute the results but don't be fooled it's all wrong. Plus takes 9 mins to wait for each result!

Did you check the numbers? I found often AI simulations are more close to estimations.

Is it back testing or just hallucinating?
