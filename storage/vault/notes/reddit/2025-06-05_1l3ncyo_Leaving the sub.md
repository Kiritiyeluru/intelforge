# Leaving the sub

My god the quality of this sub has gotten so low.

I works at one of the major HFT quant firms, and there’s basically no productive discussions about quant finance, which is really what the sub should be about. Every other post is “I’m XYZ looking to break into quant”.

One Google search and a million posts will pop up. Mods need to step it up and people posting need to stop acting like idiots who can’t bother spending 2 minutes searching for the countless other posts asking the exact same thing. If you can’t do a Google search for the thousands of posts exactly like yours then you certainly won’t figure out “how to break into quant”.

Rant over.

Don’t forget the “my algo strategy made 50000% profit in a year according to my backtest, how do I publish my results” posts.

This sub has always sucked but then again nobody is going to publish their code in C++ that they wrote to exploit the NQ order book imbalance to print money. But if you’d like to,  i’m all ears

I just come here for the lols. There are people who wouldn’t even get hired to Amazon during the peak of the tech bubble sincerely thinking that they have a chance at CitSec.

I’ve always loved that “break into” has become the solidified phrase too, almost naturally??

But yes, none of these floozies will ever make it.

I’m pretty sure quant is pushed a lot by social media “get rich like me” channels.

Hey man. I have a 3.0 GPA from a non target school without a degree in math or computer science. But I want tobreak into quant to make a lot of money. Can I DM you about how to break into quant. Oh I am also in my late 30s. Is it too late for me? Thanks

This sub has always sucked . Also if you want any real discussion like portfolio optimization, market regimes, discussing crucial parameters to trading strategies go to r/quant. Also know that you won’t really find any useful information on Reddit, due to how protected intellectual property is. No one’s going to be telling you the in and outs if it makes money lol. Your best luck is blogs or books.

Ok but what type of posts do you want to see? You havent done an AMA in 5 years, or ever on this sub for example. Obv neither you nor anyone else in this industry will share anything which can lead to the smallest benefit to a potential competitor, so exactly what do you want to discuss? "So you guys use R or Python for research" lol get real, this sub has basically no value outside of discussions about comp and "CV reviews".

You get what you give.
You are worthless as a user, so you get nothing of worth from other users.
You are the reason this sub sucks.

You can just leave. No need to announce anything.
