# 🚀Inside Chris Hohn’s TCI: Lessons from an 18% Compounder (1/2)

I cut some stuff out, full post is --> [here](https://thematicedge.substack.com/p/inside-chris-hohns-tci-lessons-from).

(...)

Hohn’s performance has been nothing short of stellar. [The fund has delivered an 18% annualized return since inception](https://hedgefundalpha.com/chris-hohn-portfolio/)—remarkably close to [Buffett’s outstanding 20% for Berkshire Hathaway shareholders](https://fortune.com/2025/05/17/warren-buffett-success-berkshire-hathaway-stocks/).

Let’s take a quick look at the portfolio and identify a few patterns. Below are the fund’s top 10 positions. With five holdings each representing more than 10% of assets, it’s fair to say the fund is highly concentrated.

One pattern that stands out is the balanced mix of asset-heavy and asset-light business models—yet all are dominant players in their respective markets:

* **Asset-heavy models** like Canadian Pacific (CP), Canadian National (CN), and Ferrovial (which operates toll roads and airports) are essentially **natural monopolies.**
* **Asset-light tech giants** like Alphabet and Microsoft command over 50% market share in their core businesses—**modern-day digital monopolies**.
* **Moody’s and S&P Global**, the leading rating agencies, are foundational to the financial system and operate in highly consolidated markets—similar to **Visa** in payments.
* **GE Aerospace**, the fund’s largest position, deserves its own mention. It’s the leader in commercial aircraft engines with an estimated 50% market share. Hohn is negative on airlines but still wants exposure to the secular growth in air travel—GE lets him monetize that trend without the margin pressure of the airline industry.

**Next week**, we’ll attempt to reconstruct the 200-stock investable universe Hohn referred to. I’m convinced it will include many thematic winners.

...

And here’s a quick breakdown of that amazing podcast with Chris Hohn from The Children’s Investment Fund.

* **Start with moats, not growth** Moats > growth. Hohn only invests in businesses with *true* barriers to entry (network effects, IP, switching costs). No moat = no thanks.Examples: Aena (airport monopoly), GE/Safran (jet engines), Meta/Visa (network scale).
* **Essential > discretionary** He likes irreplaceable businesses with pricing power — like ratings agencies or infrastructure. If you *have* to use it and they can raise prices above inflation, he’s interested.
* **No “profitless growth”** Airlines grow 5% a year… and barely make money. He avoids low-margin and overhyped businesses with no real earnings power.
* **Blacklist of bad industries** Hohn avoids sectors with high competition and little pricing power: ✘ Banks ✘ Autos ✘ Retail ✘ Insurance ✘ Airlines ✘ Commodities ✘ Media ✘ Asset managers, etc. His investable universe is only \~200 stocks globally.
* **Long-term mindset** TCI holds stocks for 8+ years. DCF > multiples. It’s all about compounding intrinsic value, not trading around short-term noise.
* **High conviction, concentrated bets** 10–15 stocks. Top 5 = 72% of the portfolio. Deep research + decades of experience = strong intuition.
* **Philanthropy at the core** Hohn donates nearly all his earnings. Proving that purpose and performance can go hand in hand.

If you’re looking for some more reasons as to why Chris Hohn owns so much GE Aerospace.

Welcome, and thanks for the comment. I agree—the stock picking is impressive and likely hard to replicate. What really caught my attention, though, was his remark that his investable universe consists of just 200 stocks. An equal-weight index of those 200 alone would have likely outperformed the market—which feels like a strategy that might actually be replicable. I’ll try to identify as many of those 200 stocks as possible—let’s see how far I get.
