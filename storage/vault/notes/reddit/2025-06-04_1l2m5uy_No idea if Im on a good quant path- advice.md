# No idea if I'm on a good quant path- advice?

Currently a rising freshman to Uni of Cambridge's CS program (I'm from the US), planning to do 4 years for my MEng.

I'm very well aware Cambridge's Part III Maths is cracked for quant, but I'm not sure about the CS program. I'm not fully sure if the CS program's math (Natural Science Tripos Math Year 1) + CS math (discrete + probability) is substantial enough.

Just want some advice on what I can do here. I know outside prep is definitely needed if I wanna break in (like the green book, etc.), but not 100% sure how substantial my out-of-school self-learning will have to be. In my CS pathway, I plan to take electives mainly in AI/ML, as well as quantum information. QComp is my primary direction rn

So tldr; Cambridge CS good for quant (trading or dev)? Lowkey worried that since I can't double major in the UK it'll be a lil tough.

My mathematics background from high school spans Multivar/Vector, Proof-based Lin Alg, Real Part I, and Complex. I'll be taking a summer course in Applied Probability and Stats, which is calc-based.

Cambridge CS is probably the best for Quant Dev in the UK. I have friends in first-year (freshman) CS at Cambridge who are interning at Citadel and GSA for Quant Dev this summer.

It gets to the point where Ocaml is taught in first-year CS because Jane Street sponsor so much research into it at Cambridge. Many Jane Street devs are from Cambridge.

You will not need to do much out-of-school learning. Campus visits from firms are pretty common.

Trading wise, it's also a top programme.

My recommendation is to keep an eye out for the Optiver Trading Academy that runs at Cambridge, I thought that was pretty good.

As others have said, for quat *dev* roles you are set.

If you want to transition to the trading/finances side, you will have to do some self-learning. There's no getting around that.

Cambridge is comfortably the best university in Europe to break into quant, and one of the best in the world alongside Harvard and MIT.

Cambridge CS is especially cracked.

i acc know a second year cs cam who is on my internship this summer - he is doing qr at a top shop that everyone on here blows about

CS is perfectly fine, loads of people interning at top shops. People generally go for SWE but you have an equally good chance for QR or QT.

Go to the events run by JS, HRT etc (usually at CMS). Get your merch at career fairs. Practice mental maths for screening. In terms of courses, you donâ€™t specialise until 3rd year but the part Ib project usually has a couple suggested by IMC or other shop employees. For modules, I would recommend ADS which was cool but a lot of work (probably reduced by the time you do it).
