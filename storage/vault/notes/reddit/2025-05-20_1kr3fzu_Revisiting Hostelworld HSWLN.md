# Revisiting Hostelworld $HSW.LN

UK small-cap, Hostelworld is a minnow in a sea of whales (e.g. Booking, Expedia) that continues to somehow survive and grow.

Fully recovered from COVID-19 -related woes, I think it's being slept on - function of size (\~$200M market cap) and listing location (UK) - as it enters FY25 debt free and poised to begin returning cash to shareholders whilst growth \~7% annually and trading at < 9x fwd P/FCF.

Any comments or feedback welcome ðŸ™‚

Nice to see a UK small cap here. I remember a hostelworld post here years ago, probably yours.

Hardly any UK investors relative to US (given the house culture).

Thanks!
