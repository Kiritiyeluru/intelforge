# Relationship between Silver and Gold

Hey guys, I was researching a strategy related to mean reversion for Silver and Gold, and saw this interesting pattern. 

https://preview.redd.it/hwurk2w4d84f1.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c9d8c7de38433c7efd0f4f0becdffd5666cd132

  
The strategy performs extremely average until 2020, with almost basically having no return. However, when it gets to 2020, it goes on cocaine and blows up faster than a mentos in a coke. I was wondering what you guys thought. 

  
I know that this is a bad strategy to take live, but this strategy made me more interested on what fundamental thing changed with gold and silver starting from 2020? Probably something from the pandemic and the economic instability, but still, I would love to hear your guys' opinion. 

  
thanks.

I think it's because of EVs. EV battery uses silver as an anti corrosion agent. So silver decoupled from gold due to new found industrial application.

Not sure theres a basis, for it except:

  
1) silver might intersting on a monetary basis..new reserve asset? 

  
2) people think they should so self-fulfilling

  
Silver is,way more industrial

Ok, i thought it was opposite you were saying OP

  
No idea why it has started to work really well

  
Decoupling (my thought) should be worse MR, more momentum or zero profit noise

lol itâ€™s a lot more simple than people are saying. Silver is more tied to real economic growth and industrial growth. Gold is not as much. Chinas decline = underperformance of silver

As I stated in my response below, part of the reason is due to increased retail trading volumes which increased volatility in basically every major market. Gold is also a risk-off asset and does well during periods of global uncertainty which has been the case continuously from 2020 to today (Covid, inflation, Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Palestine, Trump). 

Examine the average deviation (I'm assuming this is a statistical arbitrage strategy) and mean reversion half-life during the period leading up to 2020 and the period following 2020 and compare. I suspect you will see a noticeable difference in both of these factors which should explain at least some of the improved performance

Good luck.
