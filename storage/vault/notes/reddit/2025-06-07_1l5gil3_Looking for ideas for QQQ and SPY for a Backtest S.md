# Looking for ideas for QQQ and SPY for a Backtest Sunday

Hi guys,

I am running out of ideas what I could backtest. And tomorrow is Sunday and I have some computational time left. Do you have any suggestions? It does not have to be your best strategy. Maybe something that you would like to backtest yourself because it sounds promising. I will share my results.

In principle I would especially be interested in QQQ premarket. Strong moves seem nowadays happen premarket while the trading hours seem a little boring and choppy. One could take advantage of this shift with an account in Europe. I don't like that my machine is only running for 7 hours a day while most of the money is made before that.

So anything that you would love to see tested?
