# Knowledge Management - Key Insights & Lessons

## Problem Analysis
- **Issue:** 25+ articles becoming unmanageable in flat structure
- **Root Cause:** No systematic organization or AI-ready indexing
- **Impact:** Difficulty finding relevant information when needed

## Solution Approach
- **Strategy:** Hybrid approach - immediate folder organization + future AI processing
- **Tools Selected:** Free/open-source only (FAISS, Ollama, sentence-transformers)
- **Architecture:** Local-first, integrates with existing IntelForge workflow

## Key Learning Points

### What Worked
- Analyzing existing collection before building solutions
- Following IntelForge "reuse over rebuild" philosophy
- Planning phased approach (organization → AI processing → integration)

### Tools Research
- **FAISS:** Best for local vector search, completely free
- **Ollama:** Local embeddings with models like `nomic-embed-text`
- **Chroma:** Good alternative to FAISS, more user-friendly
- **Sentence-Transformers:** Mature ecosystem for embeddings

### Design Decisions
1. **Hierarchical folders first** - immediate benefit while building AI system
2. **Local embeddings** - zero recurring costs, privacy-focused
3. **Integration planning** - connects to existing trading research workflow
4. **Semantic search focus** - more powerful than folder browsing

## Anti-Patterns Avoided
- Building complex database schema upfront
- Using paid embedding services
- Over-engineering the folder structure
- Starting with AI without basic organization
