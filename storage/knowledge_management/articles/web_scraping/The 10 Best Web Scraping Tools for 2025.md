What is a Web Scraping Tool?
A web scraping tool is essentially software or a service that automates the process of extracting data from websites. It simplifies web scraping, making it easier to gather information.

Nowadays, companies often guard their publicly available data by using anti-scraping technologies. They don’t want to share it, even though it’s publicly accessible freely. Some common defences include CAPTCHAs, fingerprinting, and rate limiting, which can halt your data collection efforts if you’re not prepared.

Web scraping tools are designed to navigate these obstacles effectively. They provide the necessary features to ensure smooth data collection from websites without interruption.
