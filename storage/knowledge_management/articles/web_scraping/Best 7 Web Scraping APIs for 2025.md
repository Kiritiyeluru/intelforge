What Is a Web Scraping API?
A Web Scraping API is a tool that simplifies the process of extracting data from websites. Instead of building your own scraper, you send a request to the API with the URL and parameters like language or geolocation. The API then retrieves the data from the target website and delivers it back to you.

For example, if you want to scrape product listings from Amazon, a Web Scraping API saves you from writing scripts, setting up proxies, and managing headers. Some APIs even parse the data for you, providing structured results in formats like JSON or CSV. However, the specific features available can vary depending on the service.

7 Best Web Scraping APIs
Looking for reliable web scraping APIs to simplify data extraction? Here are the seven best web scraping APIs that can help you efficiently gather data from various websites, manage proxies, and handle complex tasks like CAPTCHA solving. These tools are designed to save you time and resources while ensuring accurate results.

1. Bright Data

Bright Data is a leading provider of web scraping APIs, offering powerful solutions for data collection through proxy-based integrations. The company’s key API products include the Web Unlocker and the SERP API.

The Web Unlocker API is a general-purpose tool designed for scraping a wide variety of websites. It comes with a 72M residential proxy pool, enabling precise country and city-level targeting across the globe. The API supports JavaScript rendering, IP rotation, and advanced anti-detection techniques to ensure high success rates. While it primarily functions as a proxy server, which can limit customization, it remains a robust solution for many use cases.

The SERP API is specifically crafted for scraping and parsing major search engines. It boasts a success rate of over 99%, making it one of the fastest and most reliable options for extracting search engine data. Like the Web Unlocker, the SERP API uses the extensive proxy pool and incorporates advanced anti-detection features like CAPTCHA solving, browser fingerprinting, automated retries, and more. As with its other products, Bright Data’s APIs provide validated and structured data.

Both APIs excel in complex environments, such as e-commerce platforms, with Bright Data’s Amazon scraper performing exceptionally well (very high success rate). In addition to the Web Scraper APIs, they also offer datasets — both from a marketplace and custom. Those datasets come with free samples for you to download before buying.

Bright Data offers two pricing models: subscription-based and pay-as-you-go. The subscription starts at $499 per month, providing better value for regular users. The pay-as-you-go option begins at $1 per 1,000 results, which may not be as cost-effective for less protected websites. The company also has a free trial plan for all its products and right now (2025) is offering a matched deposit of up to $500 — meaning if you deposit $500, Bright Data will match it and you’ll have a total balance of $1,000!
