Python & Rust Web-Scraping Ecosystem (Ubuntu/
Linux)
Python Static Scraping Libraries: Standard tools include
requests
(synchronous) and modern
alternatives like HTTPX (async, HTTP/2) 1 . For HTML parsing, common choices are BeautifulSoup4 and
lxml; faster options like Selectolax (built on the high-performance Lexbor engine) provide CSS-selector
support. These handle static pages easily. For asynchronous/multi-threaded scraping, Python’s asyncio
combined with HTTP clients (e.g. httpx.AsyncClient ) or frameworks like Scrapy (which uses Twisted)
allow concurrent requests. In Scrapy, the event-driven engine works with a Scheduler, Downloader, Spiders,
and Pipelines to process pages and items 2 3 . Scrapy natively exports data to JSON, JSON Lines, CSV, etc.
(via Feed Exports) 4 . The figure below illustrates Scrapy’s asynchronous architecture:
Scrapy’s asynchronous architecture overview: a Twisted-based Engine manages a Scheduler, Downloader (with
middlewares), Spiders, and Item Pipelines 5 .
Python Browser Automation: For dynamic (JavaScript-rendered) sites, headless browser tools are
essential. Playwright (via its Python API) automates Chromium/Firefox/Edge; it “allows scraping dynamic
JavaScript–powered websites without the need to reverse engineer their behavior” 6 . Selenium (with
Chrome/Firefox webdrivers) similarly drives real browsers – “using browser rendering power to access
dynamic content” and often avoids blocks since “real browsers tend to blend in with the crowd easier than
raw HTTP requests” 7 . Pyppeteer (a Python port of Puppeteer) and libraries like requests-html (which
can render JS with an embedded browser) are other Python options. Playwright and Selenium each support
both synchronous and asynchronous use; Playwright’s async API and built-in Docker images (Ubuntu-based,
with browsers pre-installed) make it very suited for Linux/Docker environments 8 6 .
Python Full Frameworks: Scrapy is the premier Python crawling framework. It’s fully asynchronous
(Twisted-based 2 3 ) and modular: pipelines can clean and persist data, and middlewares let you add
retry, throttling, or proxy logic. Scrapy is ideal for multi-level crawling (following links) and has built-in
exporters (JSON/CSV) 4 . Other “full” frameworks include Cloudscraper or Selenium/Playwright with
custom code, but most practitioners pair light HTTP clients (requests/httpx) + parsers with something like
Scrapy or an async loop for scale.
Rust Static Scraping Libraries: Rust’s ecosystem includes reqwest (a powerful HTTP client) and scraper
(CSS-selector parser). Reqwest “provides the features of an HTTP client” – it can open pages, handle cookies,
etc. 9 . Scraper works by parsing HTML into a tree (using html5ever under the hood) so you can run CSS
selectors 10 . These crates are used for simple, fast scraping. For async support, Rust commonly uses the
Tokio runtime; for example, a Tokio-based scraper can fetch many pages concurrently 11 . (Tokio’s async I/
O is the Rust counterpart to Python’s asyncio or Scrapy’s Twisted.)
Rust Headless/Browser Automation: For JavaScript-heavy sites, Rust has a few options. The Fantoccini
crate drives any WebDriver (Chrome/Firefox) asynchronously via the Selenium protocol. It “leverages the
WebDriver protocol to control browsers like Firefox and Chrome asynchronously, enabling Rust scrapers to
1interact seamlessly with dynamic, JavaScript-heavy web pages” 12 . ThirtyFour is a similar Rust WebDriver
client (W3C-compliant, tested on Chrome/Firefox). For direct Chrome DevTools Protocol control,
Chromiumoxide provides a high-level async API: it can launch a headless Chrome/Chromium or connect to
one via CDP 13 . (Rust also has headless_chrome crate, but it’s less active.) These tools integrate with Tokio,
letting you write non-blocking Rust browser scripts 14 . Typical usage patterns: start WebDriver (e.g.
chromedriver), connect with Fantoccini/Thirtyfour, perform clicks/queries, and await results. Although Rust’s
dynamic-scraping options lag Python’s maturity, they are steadily improving.
Headless Browsing & Dynamic Content Support
• Playwright (Python) – cross-browser, async/sync APIs. Requires playwright install
browser_name (works on Ubuntu) 15 . See example: it automates clicks, typing, waiting on JS.
• Selenium (Python) – traditional WebDriver approach. Use headless Chrome/Firefox
( chromedriver / geckodriver ). Widely documented (e.g. Selenium site). Selenium has many
third-party enhancements (undetected-chromedriver, Selenium-Stealth) to randomize fingerprint.
7
• Pyppeteer (Python) – Python wrapper of Puppeteer (Chrome). Less maintained but still used for
simple Puppeteer-style scripts.
• Fantoccini / ThirtyFour (Rust) – as above, integrate with WebDriver. Support async Tokio tasks 12 .
• Chromiumoxide (Rust) – Puppeteer-like CDP control in Rust 13 .
• Command-line tools: When appropriate, simple CLI requests are fastest. On Linux one can use
curl / wget to fetch pages and parse with tools like jq (JSON), grep / sed (text) 16 17 . For
example, curl URL | jq '.data' can pull and parse JSON quickly. These shell utilities
(combined with xargs , fd , etc.) can handle trivial tasks or be scripted into CI pipelines.
Data Pipeline & Storage
• Feed Export/Storage: Scraped items can be saved as CSV or JSON files using built-in facilities.
Scrapy’s Feed Exporter supports formats like JSON, JSONL, CSV out of the box 4 . For custom
pipelines, use Python’s csv or json modules, or pandas (load scraped dicts into a DataFrame).
For databases, Python’s sqlite3 (built-in) or PostgreSQL (via psycopg2 or ORMs like
SQLAlchemy) can store results. (For example, Scrapy pipelines can insert items into SQLite directly
18 or Postgres 19 .) In practice, small projects often dump CSV/JSON and later load into Pandas for
analysis. For larger data, one might stream to a database or use Polars (a Rust-backed DataFrame)
for fast I/O and cleaning.
• Data Cleaning: Libraries like pandas (Python) or Polars can clean and normalize scraped data
(deduplication, formatting, type conversion). Tools like Pyjanitor or pandas-datareader are also
useful for merging scraped data with financial datasets.
• Long-term Jobs / Sync: If scraping continuously, schedule jobs with cron or systemd timers on
Ubuntu. Tools like Scrapyd (Scrapy’s daemon) can deploy and run spiders on servers 20 . Scrapy
Cloud or Airflow/Prefect are cloud/enterprise options. In all cases, design your pipeline to check for
duplicates and update only what’s new (e.g. by tracking latest date).
2Anti-Detection & Stealth Techniques
• User-Agent Rotation: Never use the default Python/Scrapy UA. Use random or realistic UAs. In
Scrapy, custom middlewares like [scrapy-fake-useragent] or APIs (e.g. ScrapeOps Fake UA) can
automatically rotate thousands of UAs 21 . Requests-based scripts can use fake_useragent or
maintain a list.
• Proxy Rotation: Use a pool of IPs. Libraries like ProxyBroker (Python) can find and validate free
proxies 22 . For paid services, use rotating proxy providers (Bright Data, ScraperAPI, etc.). In Scrapy,
middlewares such as scrapy-rotating-proxies or scrapy-fixerio-proxy handle proxy
pools. The goal is to use a new IP for each request or session, avoiding rate limits.
• Browser Fingerprint Evasion: When using Selenium/Playwright, standard browsers still differ from
human usage. Tools like Selenium-Stealth (JS/WebGL fingerprint randomization) or undetected-
chromedriver attempt to mask automation traces 6 7 . For Playwright, using headless= False
and adding random delays, viewport changes, or custom Chrome args can help.
• Rate-Limiting & Delays: Throttle your crawl rate. Scrapy’s DOWNLOAD_DELAY , AUTOTHROTTLE ,
and concurrency settings prevent overloading a site. Randomizing request timing (via time.sleep
or Scrapy middlewares) makes traffic appear less bot-like.
• Cookies & Sessions: Maintain cookies (requests.Session or browser context) so you appear as a
returning user. Libraries like browser.cookies in Playwright or Selenium.get_cookies()
allow reusing sessions.
Starter Projects & Templates (Finance Focus)
• GitHub Example Scrapers: Several open repos focus on financial data scraping. For example,
[sallamy2580/python-web-scrapping] provides many Python crawlers for trading data
(WallStreetBets, CME futures, Reuters, Bloomberg, etc.) 23 . The [rbhatia46/Fetching-Financial-Data]
repo includes Jupyter notebooks demonstrating market-data pulls (Yahoo Finance API vs scraping,
AlphaVantage) 24 . Another example is [Jigisha-p/Automated-Financial-News-Scraping], which uses
BeautifulSoup to extract news for listed companies into JSON/CSV 25 . These projects show practical
patterns (how to find HTML selectors, loop through pages, handle pagination) specific to finance
sites.
• CLI Scrapers: Tools like huntrar/scrape offer rule-based CLI web scraping, and many people write
one-off Python/Rust scripts that accept args and output JSON. The key in automation is to enable
running without manual steps. Frameworks like Scrapy even have a CLI ( scrapy crawl
spidername ) and can be invoked from cron or shell scripts.
• Templates & APIs: Some organizations share boilerplate for financial scraping. For instance, tutorial
articles may link to starter GitHub repos with requirements, while trading-algo packages (like
Backtrader or Zipline) sometimes include data ingestion modules. Even generic templates
(Dockerized Scrapy image, Playwright scripts) can be adapted for any site.
• Scheduling Tools: Look for Docker images and examples. nichelia/docker-scraper is a GitHub
showing a Dockerized Python scraper on Ubuntu. Many Scrapy tutorials use cron jobs or services like
GitHub Actions to run scrapers on a schedule.
Ubuntu/Linux Enhancements
• Docker: Containerize your scraper for consistency. Official Docker images exist (e.g.
mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:latest is Ubuntu-based with browsers pre-installed
3
8
). ForSelenium, SeleniumHQ Docker images provide standalone Chrome/Firefox with drivers. Running
scrapers in Docker ensures all Linux deps (Chromium, geckodriver, fonts) are captured.
• Scheduling: Use cron or systemd timers on Ubuntu to run scraping scripts (or scrapy
crawl ) daily/weekly. For Docker, you can use a base image with cron installed. Services like
Supervisor can also ensure your scraper restarts on failure.
• CLI Utilities: Linux shell tools often complement scrapers. For example, after scraping to JSON, one
can use jq 26 to filter or transform data on the command line. Tools like sed , awk , grep 17
help extract bits from text files or logs. The Web Scraping with Bash guide notes that sometimes a
one-liner with curl | jq is faster than a full browser run 16 . Utilities like xargs , find , or
fd can chain scraping commands over file lists or URLs.
Further Reading & Tutorials
• Tool Overviews: Many recent blogs compare tools and show usage patterns. For HTTP clients,
Scrapfly’s “HTTPX with Python” highlights HTTPX’s async/HTTP2 strengths 1 . For headless
browsers, Scrapfly’s Playwright and Selenium tutorials explain how to install and use them (and why
they beat static requests ) 6 7 . These are practical introductions to using browser automation
in Python.
• Rust Guides: Articles like ScrapingBee’s “Web Scraping in Rust” walk through using reqwest ,
scraper and tokio

11 . ScrapingAnt’s “Rust Data Extraction” series covers advanced topics
(async tasks, WebDriver via Fantoccini) 12
(html5ever, etc.).

. The ZenRows blog lists Rust HTML parsers
• Anti-Detection & Best Practices: ScrapingAnt has a piece on Python anti-detection libraries
(Selenium-Stealth, proxy rotators, etc.) 27 28 . ScrapeOps provides playbooks on Scrapy best
practices (scheduling with Scrapyd 20 , rotating user agents 21 , using autothrottle, etc.). Many
forum discussions (StackOverflow, Reddit) cover real-world scraping of trading forums or news sites,
which can be found by searching for the specific site plus “scrapy” or “selenium.”
• Finance-Specific Examples: Look for blog posts or talks on scraping stock data or crypto forums.
For instance, medium.com and notebook tutorials often show scraping Yahoo Finance, or parsing
SEC filings from EDGAR. Some algorithmic-trading blogs demonstrate pulling news sentiment (from
Twitter, StockTwits) via APIs or scrapers. Combining these with workflows (scrape → clean (pandas)
→ feed into a backtester) is common in trading tutorials.
Summary: In Python, use libraries like requests/httpx + BeautifulSoup/selectolax for static pages, and
frameworks like Scrapy or Playwright/Selenium for large-scale or JS-heavy scraping. In Rust, reqwest +
scraper (+ Tokio) cover most static needs, with Fantoccini/Thirtyfour and Chromiumoxide available for
dynamic sites. Ensure Linux compatibility by using official Debian/Ubuntu packages (e.g. browsers for
headless modes), and leverage Docker for reproducibility. Employ databases or CSV for storage, and always
incorporate user-agent rotation, proxies, and polite crawling delays. The cited resources and projects above
provide detailed examples and code to get started.
