Just tested Claude with MCP (Model Context Protocol) - Mind = Blown
TL;DR: Used Claude with local MCP tools to read and modify Word documents directly. It‚Äôs like having a coding assistant that can actually touch your files. What I did:

1.	Asked Claude to analyze a job requirements document - It used a 3-step semantic search process:
‚Ä¢	READ: Extracted all paragraphs from my .docx file
‚Ä¢	EMBED: Made the content searchable (though we hit some method issues here)
‚Ä¢	SEARCH: Found specific info about experience requirements
2.	Got detailed answers - Claude found that the job required:
‚Ä¢	17 years of IT experience overall
‚Ä¢	8 years in semantic technologies
‚Ä¢	8 years in technical standards (OWL, RDF, etc.)
‚Ä¢	Proven AI/ML experience
3.	Modified the document in real-time - Then I asked Claude to update specific paragraphs, and it actually changed the Word document on my machine:

‚Ä¢	Updated paragraph 14 to ‚ÄúTest MCP agent‚Äù
‚Ä¢	Updated paragraph 15 to ‚Äúsalut maman‚Äù (lol)
Why this is crazy: ‚Ä¢ Claude isn‚Äôt just reading or generating text anymore ‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs actually executing commands on my local system ‚Ä¢ Reading real files, modifying real documents ‚Ä¢ All through natural conversation The technical side: Claude used MCP commands like: ‚Ä¢ mcp.fs.read_docx_paragraphs to extract content ‚Ä¢ mcp.fs.update_docx_paragraphs to modify specific paragraphs

It even figured out the correct parameter formats through trial and error when I gave it the wrong method name initially. This feels like the future We‚Äôre moving from ‚ÄúAI that talks‚Äù to ‚ÄúAI that does‚Äù. Having an assistant that can read your documents, understand them, AND modify them based on conversation is wild. Anyone else experimenting with MCP? What local tools are you connecting to Claude?

Claude Code PLAN mode.
Productivity
Maybe you miss it:

Plan mode is a special operating mode in Claude Code that allows you to research, analyze, and create implementation plans without making any actual changes to your system or codebase.

What Plan Mode Does:

Research & Analysis Only:

Read files and examine code

Search through codebases

Analyze project structure

Gather information from web sources

Review documentation

No System Changes:

Cannot edit files

Cannot run bash commands that modify anything

Cannot create/delete files

Cannot make git commits

Cannot install packages or change configurations

When Plan Mode Activates:
Plan mode is typically activated when:

You ask for planning or analysis before implementation

You want to understand a codebase before making changes

You request a detailed implementation strategy

The system detects you want to plan before executing

How It Works:

Research Phase: I gather all necessary information using read-only tools

Plan Creation: I develop a comprehensive implementation plan

Plan Presentation: I use the exit_plan_mode tool to present the plan

User Approval: You review and approve the plan

Execution Phase: After approval, I can proceed with actual implementation

Benefits:

Safety: Prevents accidental changes during exploration

Thorough Planning: Ensures comprehensive analysis before implementation

User Control: You approve exactly what will be done before it happens

Better Outcomes: Well-planned implementations tend to be more successful

Created an agentic meta prompt that generates powerful 3-agent workflows for Claude Code
Coding
Hey r/ClaudeAI!

I've been experimenting with multi-agent orchestration patterns and created a meta prompt that generates surprisingly effective minimal agent systems. Thought this community might find it interesting!

Get it here: https://gist.github.com/RchGrav/438eafd62d58f3914f8d569769d0ebb3

The Pattern: The meta prompt generates a 3-agent system:

Atlas (Orchestrator) - Manages the workflow and big picture

Mercury (Specialist) - Multi-talented worker that handles research, coding, writing, testing

Apollo (Evaluator) - Quality control with harsh but specific feedback

What makes it effective:

Blackboard Architecture - All agents share a single context.md file instead of complex message passing. Simple but powerful.

Quality loops - Apollo scores outputs 0-100 and provides specific improvements. System iterates until score ‚â• 90. This virtually eliminates the "good enough" problem.

Cognitive load management - Uses "think hard" and "ultrathink" directives to allocate Claude's reasoning appropriately.

Minimal but complete - Just 3 roles handle what typically requires 10+ specialized agents. Less coordination overhead = better results.

Real-world usage: I've used this for:

Building full-stack features from requirements

Refactoring legacy codebases

Creating technical documentation

Designing and implementing system architectures

The meta prompt adapts the agent system to whatever task you throw at it. It's ~130 lines of markdown that generates the entire workflow.

For the tinkerers: I also built ClaudeBox (https://github.com/RchGrav/claudebox), a Docker environment with 15+ dev profiles and built-in MCP servers. Great for running these workflows in isolated containers.

Would love to hear if anyone tries this out! What multi-agent patterns have worked well for you with Claude?

Enjoy! I hope this helps you out!

No more terminal! Just used Claude Code to create a chat interface for... itself
Claude Code is one of the best AI coding agents out there, if not the best, but many people complain about having to use it in the terminal.

So, I built a VS Code extension that gives Claude Code a beautiful chat interface, right inside your editor!

Key features:

üñ•Ô∏è No Terminal Required ‚Äì Interact through a clean, modern chat U

I‚è™ Restore Checkpoints ‚Äì Easily undo changes and restore code to any previous state

üíæ Conversation History ‚Äì Better session and history management

‚ö° Instant Access ‚Äì Claude Code integrated directly into VS Code

üé® VS Code Native ‚Äì Seamlessly matches your theme and editor UI

üìÅ Smart File Context ‚Äì Reference any file using simple @ mentions

üõë Full Control ‚Äì Start, stop, and manage AI processes

Built the entire thing in a weekend, Claude Code is fun!

If you‚Äôd like to try it, just search "Claude Code Chat" in the VS Code Marketplace or download it here:

Prompt I use to prevent Claude from being a sycophant
Productivity
Conversation Guidelines
Primary Objective: Engage in honest, insight-driven dialogue that advances understanding.

Core Principles
Intellectual honesty: Share genuine insights without unnecessary flattery or dismissiveness

Critical engagement: Push on important considerations rather than accepting ideas at face value

Balanced evaluation: Present both positive and negative opinions only when well-reasoned and warranted

Directional clarity: Focus on whether ideas move us forward or lead us astray

What to Avoid
Sycophantic responses or unwarranted positivity

Dismissing ideas without proper consideration

Superficial agreement or disagreement

Flattery that doesn't serve the conversation

Success Metric
The only currency that matters: Does this advance or halt productive thinking? If we're heading down an unproductive path, point it out directly.

I Might Have Just Built the Easiest Way to Create Complex AI Prompts
Project

0:07 / 1:18




I love to build, I think i'm addicted to it. My latest build is a visual, drag and drop prompt builder. I can't attach an image here i don't think but essentially you add different cards which have input and output nodes such as:

Persona Role

Scenario Context

User input

System Message

Specific Task

If/Else Logic

Iteration

Output Format

Structured Data Output

And loads more...

Each of these you drag on and connect the nodes/ to create the flow. You can then modify the data on each of the cards or press the AI Fill which then asks you what prompt you are trying to build and it fills it all out for you.

Is this a good idea for those who want to make complex prompt workflows but struggle getting their thoughts on paper or have i insanely over-engineered something that isn't even useful.

Looking for thoughts not traffic, thank you

PSA - don't forget you can invoke subagents in Claude code.
Suggestion
I've seen lots of posts examining running Claude instances in multiagent frameworks to emulate an full dev team and such.

I've read the experiences of people who've found their Claude instances have gone haywire and outright hallucinated or "lied" or outright fabricated that it has done task X or Y or has done code for X and Z.

I believe that we are overlooking an salient and important feature that is being underutilised which is the Claude subagents. Claude's official documentation highlights when we should be invoking subagents (for complex tasks, verifying details or investigating specific problems and reviewing multiple files and documents) + for testing also.

I've observed my context percentage has lasted vastly longer and the results I'm getting much much more better than previous use.

You have to be pretty explicit in the subagent invocation " use subagents for these tasks " ," use subagents for this project" invoke it multiple times in your prompt.

I have also not seen the crazy amount of virtual memory being used anymore either.

I believe the invocation allows Claude to either use data differently locally by more explicitly mapping the links between information or it's either handling the information differently at the back end. Beyond just spawning multiple subagents.
