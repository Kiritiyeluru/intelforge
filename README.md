Here is the updated `README.md` for **IntelForge**, now with your **Simplicity Philosophy** seamlessly baked in. This version clearly communicates your purpose, prevents future over-engineering, and sets expectations for anyone (including AI) who reads or contributes to the code.

# üß† IntelForge

_A personal AI-powered knowledge extraction system for web scraping and intelligence gathering._

---

## üöÄ Overview

**IntelForge** is a solo-developed, AI-assisted project designed to help me build a long-term, modular agent that scrapes and organizes valuable knowledge from public online sources ‚Äî especially in the fields of **algorithmic trading**, **technical strategy mining**, and **financial research**.

Rather than reinventing common tools, this system wraps reliable scraping methods with minimal logic and intelligent automation ‚Äî all built using AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is for **personal, non-commercial use only** and respects site TOS and robots.txt wherever applicable.

---

## üéØ Core Objectives

### ‚úÖ What I'm Building

- A **simple, AI-cooperative pipeline** that can:
  - Scrape content from target sources (GitHub, Reddit, Medium, PDFs, etc.)
  - Extract and summarize relevant ideas (e.g. strategies, indicators, backtests)
  - Store those insights as markdown notes for long-term use

### üí° Why I'm Building It

- I build **alone**, from scratch, with **no formal coding background**
- I rely on **AI** to help me write, fix, and evolve the code
- I need a system that is:
  - üß† *Understandable by a non-CS user*
  - üß± *Modular and AI-regenerable*
  - üßπ *Simple enough to maintain over years*

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Simplicity-First Development Philosophy

> ‚ÄúWe are building a lab notebook, not a SaaS platform.‚Äù
| ‚ùå Don‚Äôt Use                | ‚úÖ Use Instead                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Rebuild tools from scratch | üì¶ Use trusted libraries or wrap open-source tools |

- [‚ôªÔ∏è Find vs Build Checklist](docs/find_vs_build.md)
- [ü§ñ AI Prompt Template ‚Äì Tool Discovery](prompts/find_tools_template.md)


## ‚ôªÔ∏è Reuse Over Rebuild

> ‚ÄúIf someone smarter has already built it ‚Äî I‚Äôll use it.‚Äù

IntelForge is grounded in the principle of **reusing existing libraries, tools, and open-source implementations** wherever possible. The purpose of this system is not to reinvent common scraping, summarization, or backtesting logic ‚Äî it is to:
- Identify and **wrap** trusted tools
- Use AI to glue them together intelligently
- Avoid building brittle code for problems that are already solved

### ‚úÖ Reuse Checklist for Every Phase:
- [ ] Did I search GitHub / PyPI / Reddit / arXiv before writing any custom logic?
- [ ] Is this already available as a library or CLI tool?
- [ ] Can I wrap this in a function instead of building from scratch?
- [ ] Would future AI agents benefit more from a known tool than new code?

When in doubt: **Search, evaluate, wrap ‚Äî don‚Äôt rebuild.**

### ‚ùå Avoiding Unnecessary Complexity

| ‚ùå Don‚Äôt Use | ‚úÖ Use Instead |
|-------------|----------------|
| `src/`, `lib/`, abstract modules | Flat script layout (1 file per phase) |
| Custom classes for everything | Named functions in a script |
| Over-abstracted configs | One `config.py` or `config.yaml` |
| Full test frameworks | Manual tests + `--dry-run` mode |
| Framework-based structure | Readable, small AI-friendly scripts |

### üß≠ Design Check Before Adding Anything:
- Would I understand this in 3 months?
- Can this live in one file instead of three?
- Would this make AI-generated fixes harder?
- Is it adding value or just structure?

If the answer is no ‚Äî **keep it simple**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tooling Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|----------|----------------|
| üîπ Flat, simple structure | Avoids overmodularization |
| üîπ Clear prompt history | Everything AI-generated is saved |
| üîπ Config-first design | Change behavior without editing code |
| üîπ Test-friendly by design | Includes dry-run mode and test data |
| üîπ Logging by default | Logs to markdown or plaintext logs |

---

## üß™ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo privately.
2. Add your API keys and settings to `config.py` or `config.yaml`.
3. Run the health check:
   ```bash
   python scripts/health_check.py
````

4. Start the GitHub fetcher in dry-run mode:

   ```bash
   python phase_01_github.py --dry-run
   ```
5. Output will be saved to:

   * ‚úÖ Notes: `vault/notes/`
   * ‚úÖ Logs: `vault/logs/`

## üîç Success Criteria

| ‚úÖ What Success Looks Like                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Everything lives in 1‚Äì2 files per phase                       |
| Total repo is understandable in under 5 mins                  |
| Can be fully managed by solo user with AI help                |
| Doesn‚Äôt look or feel like a commercial codebase               |
| System builds toward a personal research brain, not a product |

---

## üß† Development Process

* All code is written using AI (Claude or GPT), based on saved prompts in `/prompts`
* Every script includes a docstring, inline comments, and fallback logic
* I follow a **10-point development checklist** in `/docs/development_checklist.md`
* I use versioned prompt files to track how each module was built or fixed

---

## üîí Ethics & Legal Use

* No scraping behind paywalls or logins
* Only uses official APIs or public RSS where possible
* Designed for personal research and educational purposes only

---

## ‚ú® Future Ideas

* Local summarization using LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio)
* Obsidian plugin for summarizing vault content
* Periodic scraping jobs + auto-digests (cron + markdown)
* GPT-based chat agent for asking:

  > ‚ÄúWhat strategies have I collected that use Z-Score + SMA?‚Äù

---

## ü§ù Collaborators & Credits

This project is personal and private, but credits go to:

* Claude + GPT (AI pair-programmers)
* The open-source community that shares knowledge publicly
* Tools like Obsidian, PRAW, and PyGitHub

## üóÇÔ∏è Knowledge Management System

**Current Status:** Phases 7 & 8 operational with 47 articles organized + AI search

## ü™ù Claude Code Hooks Integration

**Current Status:** 3 automation hooks configured for seamless workflow

IntelForge leverages Claude Code's hook system to automate critical development tasks:

### ‚úÖ Active Hooks

| Hook Type | Trigger | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Bash Command Logging** | PreToolUse (Bash) | Logs all shell commands to `~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt` for debugging |
| **Phase File Validation** | PreToolUse (Write/Edit) | Enforces `phase_XX_name.py` naming convention |
| **Knowledge Auto-Organization** | PostToolUse (Write) | Triggers article organizer when files added to `intake/` |

### üéØ Benefits

- **Consistency**: Automatic enforcement of naming conventions
- **Visibility**: Complete audit trail of all operations
- **Efficiency**: Auto-organization of knowledge without manual intervention
- **Reliability**: Workflow automation reduces human error

### üîß Hook Configuration

Hooks are configured in `.claude/settings.json` and activate automatically. To modify:

1. **Via UI**: Use `/hooks` command in Claude Code terminal
2. **Via File**: Edit `.claude/settings.json` directly
3. **Scope**: Project-level (applies to IntelForge only)

**Configuration Location**: `.claude/settings.json` ‚Üí `"hooks"` section

### Auto-Organization (Phase 7) ‚úÖ
**Workflow:**
1. Save new articles to `knowledge_management/intake/`
2. Run `python phase_07_article_organizer.py` to auto-categorize  
3. Articles moved to organized folders based on content analysis
4. Categories: claude_mcp, web_scraping, ai_workflows, productivity

**Commands:**
```bash
# Test organization (safe)
python phase_07_article_organizer.py --dry-run

# Organize articles once
python phase_07_article_organizer.py

# Watch continuously  
python phase_07_article_organizer.py --watch
```

### AI-Powered Semantic Search (Phase 8) ‚úÖ
**Setup:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install sentence-transformers faiss-cpu numpy

# Build vector database (one-time)
python phase_08_ai_processor.py --build
```

**Search Commands:**
```bash
# Semantic search examples
python phase_08_ai_processor.py --search "MCP servers"
python phase_08_ai_processor.py --search "web scraping Python libraries"
python phase_08_ai_processor.py --search "Claude Code productivity tips"
```

**Technical Details:**
- 1,683 chunks processed from 47 articles
- 384-dimensional embeddings (sentence-transformers)
- FAISS vector database (4MB total)
- <1 second search time, 0.7-0.8+ similarity scores
- 100% local, no cloud dependencies
