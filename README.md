# 🧠 IntelForge

_A personal AI-powered knowledge extraction system for web scraping and intelligence gathering._

---

## 🚀 Overview

**IntelForge** is a solo-developed, AI-assisted project designed to help me build a long-term, modular agent that scrapes and organizes valuable knowledge from public online sources — especially in the fields of **algorithmic trading**, **technical strategy mining**, and **financial research**.

Rather than reinventing common tools, this system wraps reliable scraping methods with minimal logic and intelligent automation — all built using AI tools like Claude or ChatGPT.

> ⚠️ This project is for **personal, non-commercial use only** and respects site TOS and robots.txt wherever applicable.

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

### ✅ What I'm Building

- A **simple, AI-cooperative pipeline** that can:
  - Scrape content from target sources (GitHub, Reddit, Medium, PDFs, etc.)
  - Extract and summarize relevant ideas (e.g. strategies, indicators, backtests)
  - Store those insights as markdown notes for long-term use

### 💡 Why I'm Building It

- I build **alone**, from scratch, with **no formal coding background**
- I rely on **AI** to help me write, fix, and evolve the code
- I need a system that is:
  - 🧠 *Understandable by a non-CS user*
  - 🧱 *Modular and AI-regenerable*
  - 🧹 *Simple enough to maintain over years*

## 🧘‍♂️ Simplicity-First Development Philosophy

> “We are building a lab notebook, not a SaaS platform.”
| ❌ Don’t Use                | ✅ Use Instead                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Rebuild tools from scratch | 📦 Use trusted libraries or wrap open-source tools |

### 🧠 See Also:
- [♻️ Find vs Build Checklist](guidance/core_essentials/find_vs_build.md)
- [🤖 AI Prompt Template – Tool Discovery](prompts/find_tools_template.md)


## ♻️ Reuse Over Rebuild

> “If someone smarter has already built it — I’ll use it.”

IntelForge is grounded in the principle of **reusing existing libraries, tools, and open-source implementations** wherever possible. The purpose of this system is not to reinvent common scraping, summarization, or backtesting logic — it is to:
- Identify and **wrap** trusted tools
- Use AI to glue them together intelligently
- Avoid building brittle code for problems that are already solved

### ✅ Reuse Checklist for Every Phase:
- [ ] Did I search GitHub / PyPI / Reddit / arXiv before writing any custom logic?
- [ ] Is this already available as a library or CLI tool?
- [ ] Can I wrap this in a function instead of building from scratch?
- [ ] Would future AI agents benefit more from a known tool than new code?

When in doubt: **Search, evaluate, wrap — don’t rebuild.**

### ❌ Avoiding Unnecessary Complexity

| ❌ Don’t Use | ✅ Use Instead |
|-------------|----------------|
| `src/`, `lib/`, abstract modules | Flat script layout (1 file per phase) |
| Custom classes for everything | Named functions in a script |
| Over-abstracted configs | One `config.py` or `config.yaml` |
| Full test frameworks | Manual tests + `--dry-run` mode |
| Framework-based structure | Readable, small AI-friendly scripts |

### 🧭 Design Check Before Adding Anything:
- Would I understand this in 3 months?
- Can this live in one file instead of three?
- Would this make AI-generated fixes harder?
- Is it adding value or just structure?

If the answer is no — **keep it simple**.

**Phase 3 (Planned)**: Advanced refactoring safety, knowledge base optimization

See [`guidance/operations/claude_code_hooks_maintenance_plan.md`](guidance/operations/claude_code_hooks_maintenance_plan.md) for complete strategy.

### Auto-Organization (Phase 7) ✅
**Workflow:**
1. Save new articles to `knowledge_management/intake/`
2. Run `python phase_07_article_organizer.py` to auto-categorize  
3. Articles moved to organized folders based on content analysis
4. Categories: claude_mcp, web_scraping, ai_workflows, productivity

**Commands:**
```bash
# Test organization (safe)
python phase_07_article_organizer.py --dry-run

# Organize articles once
python phase_07_article_organizer.py

# Watch continuously  
python phase_07_article_organizer.py --watch
```

### AI-Powered Semantic Search (Phase 8) ✅
**Setup:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install sentence-transformers faiss-cpu numpy

# Build vector database (one-time)
python phase_08_ai_processor.py --build
```

**Search Commands:**
```bash
# Semantic search examples
python phase_08_ai_processor.py --search "MCP servers"
python phase_08_ai_processor.py --search "web scraping Python libraries"
python phase_08_ai_processor.py --search "Claude Code productivity tips"
```

**Technical Details:**
- 1,683 chunks processed from 59 articles
- 384-dimensional embeddings (sentence-transformers)
- FAISS vector database (4MB total)
- <1 second search time, 0.7-0.8+ similarity scores
