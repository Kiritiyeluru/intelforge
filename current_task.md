# Current Task - GitHub Projects Automation Setup

## Active Work: Enhanced Project Roadmap and Phase 1 Preparation

**Current Phase:** Transition from Phase 0 (Complete) to Phase 1 (Reddit Scraping)

**Started:** 2025-01-06

## What's Being Worked On

### Primary Objective
Setting up GitHub Projects automation and session handover system to prevent the documentation rot that has led to burning previous repositories.

### Current Implementation Details

1. **âœ… Completed:**
   - Created remote GitHub repository: https://github.com/Kiritiyeluru/intelforge
   - Updated GitHub Projects README.md with IntelForge-specific content
   - Defined session handover system with three critical files

2. **ðŸ”„ In Progress:**
   - Creating session handover documentation files
   - Setting up project management templates

3. **âœ… Completed This Session:**
   - Enhanced project roadmap with detailed Phase 1 implementation plan
   - Added Simplicity-First Development Guidelines
   - Created comprehensive next steps checklist for Phase 1
   - Updated roadmap with time estimates and success criteria
   - Researched existing tools and validated PRAW + Reddit2Text approach
   - Documented comprehensive MCP setup guide for future tool integration
   - **Installed 6 powerful MCP servers for enhanced development capabilities:**
     - Perplexity Search: Real-time research and validation
     - Financial Datasets: Stock market data and analysis
     - SQLite: Local database for content storage
     - Puppeteer: Advanced web scraping capabilities
     - GitHub Server: Repository mining and code analysis
     - Brave Search: Privacy-focused web search

### Specific Technical Decisions Made

- **Phase 1 Approach:** Start with PRAW library research before implementation
- **Success Criteria:** Extract 10+ posts from r/algotrading as validation
- **Directory Structure:** vault/notes/reddit/ for organized output
- **Development Pattern:** Research â†’ Configure â†’ Implement â†’ Test â†’ Validate

## Next Immediate Steps

**Ready for Phase 1 Implementation:**
1. Research PRAW library using find_tools_template.md
2. Set up Reddit API credentials and config.yaml
3. Begin phase_01_reddit.py implementation
4. Follow enhanced roadmap in cline_docs/projectRoadmap.md

## Context for Handover

This session focused on adapting existing AgentForge automation documentation to IntelForge's needs, with emphasis on preventing documentation decay through structured session handovers. The user has explicitly stated that documentation is crucial due to burning several repos from poor documentation maintenance.
