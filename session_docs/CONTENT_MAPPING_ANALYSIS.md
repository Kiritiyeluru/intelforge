The content mapping analysis has significant gaps and needs major updates. Key findings:

  Missing Critical Content:
  - Complete 4-phase semantic crawler implementation (1,345+ lines of technical details)
  - Performance metrics: 18.07x speedup, 9,047 indicators/second processing
  - CLI enhancement plan (228 lines) completely missing from analysis
  - Enterprise testing infrastructure details across all phases

  Major Inaccuracies:
  - Phase completion files marked "needs analysis" but actually contain extensive technical details
  - Underrepresents massive transformation from basic crawler to enterprise platform
  - Content volume underestimated - actual 6,334+ lines vs mapped coverage

  Critical Recommendations:
  1. Add missing next_steps.md analysis (CLI enhancement roadmap)
  2. Update all phase completion file statuses - they're fully analyzed with unique technical content
  3. Preserve technical implementation archive - don't consolidate phase completion files
  4. Include performance benchmarks and enterprise testing infrastructure details

  The content mapping needs significant updates before proceeding with reorganization to prevent loss of critical technical
  implementation details.
