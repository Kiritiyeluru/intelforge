You're absolutely right. A 1300-line document is becoming inefficient for targeted updates. Based on your existing session_docs/ structure, I recommend breaking it into focused documents:

  Recommended Structure:
  session_docs/
  ├── PROJECT_STATUS.md          # High-level overview (100-200 lines)
  ├── ROADMAP.md                 # Detailed roadmap and phases
  ├── CURRENT_TASK.md            # Active work and immediate focus
  ├── COMPLETED_TASKS.md         # Accomplishments and history
  ├── NEXT_STEPS.md              # Immediate priorities and dependencies
  └── SESSION_HANDOVER.md        # Technical handover notes

  Benefits:
  - Faster reads: Read only what you need
  - Targeted updates: Update specific sections without processing entire document
  - Better automation: Claude Code hooks can target specific files
  - Cleaner workflow: Focus on relevant information
  - Easier maintenance: Less cognitive overhead

  PROJECT_STATUS.md becomes a dashboard:
  # IntelForge Project Status Dashboard

  ## Current Status
  - **Phase**: [link to CURRENT_TASK.md]
  - **Progress**: 85% Phase 2C complete
  - **Next**: [link to NEXT_STEPS.md]

  ## Quick Links
  - [📋 Current Task](CURRENT_TASK.md)
  - [🗺️ Roadmap](ROADMAP.md)
  - [✅ Completed](COMPLETED_TASKS.md)
  - [⏭️ Next Steps](NEXT_STEPS.md)

  This aligns with your existing session management protocols and Claude Code hooks. Want me to help restructure it?

> yes, please but dont modify or delete project plan, i need it for rechecking if we have incorporated everything into new docs
