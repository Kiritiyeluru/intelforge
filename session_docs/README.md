## Documentation Status: CONSOLIDATED âœ…

This directory has been reorganized to eliminate confusion and provide a single source of truth for project status.

## Current Active Files

### ðŸŽ¯ PRIMARY STATUS FILE
- **`PROJECT_STATUS.md`** - **USE THIS FILE** for all project status tracking
  - Consolidated view of all phases and components
  - Current active work and priorities
  - System architecture and statistics
  - Development workflow and commands
  - Success metrics and risk mitigation

### ðŸ“‹ WORKFLOW SUPPORT
- **`session_checklist.md`** - Development workflow checklist (if needed)
- **`README.md`** - This file explaining the documentation structure

## Deprecated Files (Historical Reference Only)

These files contain outdated information from January 2025 and should not be used for current project guidance:

- ~~`current_task.md`~~ - Outdated (January 2025) - Use `PROJECT_STATUS.md` instead
- ~~`next_task.md`~~ - Outdated (January 2025) - Use `PROJECT_STATUS.md` instead  
- ~~`session_summary.md`~~ - Outdated (January 2025) - Use `PROJECT_STATUS.md` instead
