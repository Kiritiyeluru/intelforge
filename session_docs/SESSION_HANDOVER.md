- **CLI tools**: ripgrep 132x faster than grep (verified)  
- **Package management**: uv 40x faster than pip (verified)
- **Performance test framework** operational

### **📋 Strategic Planning**
**Created two comprehensive planning documents:**
1. **UPDATED_STRATEGIC_PLAN.md** - 4-6 week roadmap with 5 phases
2. **IMMEDIATE_ACTION_PLAN.md** - Tactical 3-session implementation guide

## 🎯 **NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES**

### **🏆 HIGHEST PRIORITY: Patchright Integration**
**Session 2 Goal**: Replace Playwright with undetected Patchright
- **Duration**: 3-4 hours
- **Impact**: Bypass all major bot detection services
- **Target**: Access protected financial sites (Finviz, Yahoo Finance)

### **🔧 Implementation Ready**
```bash
# Installation commands ready
pip install patchright
patchright install chrome

# Integration points identified
1. Update playwright_scraper.py imports
2. Configure stealth settings
