## Purpose
Track architectural and implementation decisions with rationale to prevent repeated discussions and maintain context across sessions.

## 2025-01-06: GitHub Projects Automation Setup

**Decision:** Three-file handover system (current_task.md, next_task.md, session_summary.md)  
**Alternatives Considered:** Single status file, Git commit messages only, Complex project management tools  
**Rationale:** User has burned repos due to documentation decay; need lightweight but comprehensive context preservation  
**Impact:** Prevents information loss between sessions, supports solo+AI development  
**Status:** Implemented  

**Decision:** Phase-based commit message format (phase_XX: description)  
**Alternatives Considered:** Conventional Commits, free-form messages  
**Rationale:** Aligns with IntelForge's phase_XX module naming convention  
**Impact:** Consistent tracking of work across development phases  
**Status:** Implemented  

**Decision:** GitHub issue templates over freeform issues  
**Alternatives Considered:** Simple issue creation, external task management  
**Rationale:** Standardizes information capture, prevents incomplete task descriptions  
**Impact:** More structured development workflow  
**Status:** Implemented
