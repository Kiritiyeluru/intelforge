You've built a **robust, pluggable, validation-aware, stealth-sensitive canary system** for bots/web scrapers ‚Äî great for maintaining operational assurance in adversarial environments.

If you‚Äôre looking for **prebuilt tools** that can replace or emulate your system's capabilities (even partially), here‚Äôs a breakdown of **tools, services, and frameworks** that map to each functionality you‚Äôve implemented ‚Äî along with pros/cons of using them instead of building in-house:

---

### üîé 1. **Canary/Smoke Testing Frameworks**

Use these for health validation of scraping infrastructure, pipelines, or APIs.

#### ‚úÖ **[Checkly](https://www.checklyhq.com/)**

> **Purpose:** Synthetic monitoring + API/browser check runner
> **Strengths:** Headless browser + JS validation, retries, alerting
> **Replaces:** `run_canary_check`, `run_all_canary_checks`, content validation + caching

* ‚úÖ Browser-based checks (Puppeteer/Playwright)
* ‚úÖ JS rendering support
* ‚úÖ Custom assertions via JS
* ‚ùå Not focused on anti-detection or scraping-specific stealth

#### ‚úÖ **[Assertible](https://assertible.com/)** or **\[Pingdom + Webhooks]**

> API monitoring with content validation rules
> Mostly good for **API status + response body checking**.

---

### üß† 2. **Stealth & Anti-Bot Detection Testing**

Tools to simulate and test for bot detection and fingerprinting defenses.

#### ‚úÖ **[Botd by Fingerprint.com](https://fingerprint.com/bot-detection/)**

> **Purpose:** Test browser fingerprinting + bot detection
> **Replaces:** `anti_detection_basic`, `validate_yahoo_finance`, detection checks
> ‚úÖ Free browser fingerprint testing
> ‚ùå No direct validation automation ‚Äî you'd still need a harness around it

#### ‚úÖ **[CreepJS](https://github.com/abrahamjuliot/creepjs)** (open source)

> JS-based stealth checker for browsers ‚Äî comparable to bot.sannysoft.com
> Embed into tests to validate stealth
> ‚ùå Doesn‚Äôt do full page validation or headless control

---

### ü§ñ 3. **Browser Automation with Assertions**

These replace your `IntelBotDriverV2`, DOM content assertions, and stealth browser logic.

#### ‚úÖ **[Playwright Test + Stealth Plugin](https://playwright.dev/)**

> **Modern headless browser + testing tool**
> **With Playwright Stealth** plugin: evades basic bot detection
> ‚úÖ Full DOM access + JS exec
> ‚úÖ Fine-grained assertions (`expect().toContainText()` etc.)
> ‚úÖ Emulates real browsers, supports multiple contexts
> ‚ùå Needs test infra around it

#### ‚úÖ **[Puppeteer + Puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/tree/master/packages/puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth)**

> Chromium-based automation, but weaker than Playwright
> More mature for anti-detection logic, especially combined with `puppeteer-extra`
> ‚ùå Puppeteer less reliable for stealth lately vs. Playwright

---

### üíæ 4. **Caching + State Tracking Tools**

Used in your `_load_cache()` / `_save_cache()` and validation timing

#### ‚úÖ **Redis + TTL**

> Use `redis.set("canary_results", result, ex=1800)`
> ‚ùå Requires setup, but scales easily across processes/instances

#### ‚úÖ **Filesystem-based cache with `joblib` or `diskcache`**

> `joblib.Memory` or `diskcache.Cache`
> Lightweight, Python-native cache with expiry

---

### üìà 5. **Uptime + Workflow Gatekeeping**

Use these for your `EnhancedPipelineGatekeeper` logic

#### ‚úÖ **[Airflow Sensors + Health Checks](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/sensors.html)**

> Monitor preconditions before starting pipelines
> You can write a **custom sensor** that checks canary test results from Checkly, Redis, or your test service

#### ‚úÖ **[Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/)**

> Workflow orchestration with conditional logic
> Great if you're already using it for data pipelines

---

### ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED COMBO FOR PRODUCTION:

| Capability               | Prebuilt Replacement                                 |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Canary checks            | ‚úÖ Checkly or Playwright Test (with headless browser) |
| Anti-bot detection check | ‚úÖ Fingerprint.com Botd + Sannysoft + CreepJS         |
| JS & DOM validation      | ‚úÖ Playwright (with `expect` validations)             |
| Cache                    | ‚úÖ Redis / joblib / diskcache                         |
| Readiness Gatekeeping    | ‚úÖ Airflow/Pipeline Sensors or Prefect Tasks          |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è If you want to use Playwright to replicate your system:

```bash
pip install pytest-playwright
playwright install
```

```python
# tests/test_canary.py
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def test_finviz_canary():
    with sync_playwright() as p:
        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True)
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto("https://finviz.com")
        content = page.content()
        assert "screener" in content.lower()
        assert "finviz" in content.lower()
        assert not any(k in content.lower() for k in ["access denied", "blocked", "captcha"])
        browser.close()
```

---

### Summary

If your priority is **low-maintenance, scalable validation with alerting**, you should lean toward:

* ‚úÖ **Checkly** for plug-and-play canary validation
* ‚úÖ **Playwright Test** for stealth browser validation
* ‚úÖ **Redis** or **joblib** for stateful caching
* ‚úÖ **Prefect/Airflow** for pipeline orchestration based on system health

Let me know if you'd like a starter repo or migration plan for any of these options.
