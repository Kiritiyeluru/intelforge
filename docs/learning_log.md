# Learning Log - IntelForge

## Purpose
Capture important discoveries, insights, and lessons learned during development to build institutional knowledge and prevent repeating research.

## 2025-01-06: Documentation System Design

### Key Insight: Documentation Decay Prevention
**Discovery:** User has burned multiple repositories due to documentation decay  
**Implication:** Documentation is not optional - it's critical infrastructure  
**Lesson:** Treat documentation updates as non-negotiable part of development workflow  
**Application:** Built comprehensive handover system with mandatory session checklist  

### Insight: AI-Assisted Development Patterns
**Discovery:** Solo development with AI assistance requires different documentation patterns  
**Key Requirements:**
- Context must be immediately accessible (3-5 minute session startup)
- Decisions need rationale, not just implementation
- Handovers must be complete enough for different AI assistants
**Application:** Created decision_log.md and comprehensive session_summary.md  

### Technical Learning: GitHub CLI Limitations
**Discovery:** GitHub CLI version doesn't support project management commands  
**Workaround:** Manual project board setup via web interface  
**Future:** Monitor GitHub CLI updates for project automation features  
**Documentation:** Added to troubleshooting_guide.md

## Development Philosophy Insights

### Simplicity vs. Completeness Balance
**Observation:** IntelForge aims for "lab notebook" simplicity, not SaaS complexity  
**Tension:** Comprehensive documentation can feel like over-engineering  
**Resolution:** Documentation serves the core goal - preventing project abandonment  
**Principle:** If it prevents burning the repo, it's not over-engineering  

### Phase-Based Development Benefits
**Discovery:** phase_XX naming convention provides natural organization  
**Benefits:**
- Clear progression tracking
- Easy to regenerate individual modules
- Natural commit message convention
- Supports "reuse over rebuild" philosophy
**Application:** Integrated into all templates and automation

## Research and Tool Discovery

### Effective Tool Research Patterns
**Template:** prompts/find_tools_template.md approach prevents wheel reinvention  
**Best Practice:** Always research before building custom solutions  
**Time Investment:** 30-60 minutes research saves days of implementation  
**Documentation:** Must capture tool selection rationale in decision_log.md  

### Configuration Management Insights
**Learning:** API key management is critical from day one  
**Pattern:** config.yaml with .gitignore + config.yaml.template pattern  
**Security:** Never commit secrets, even in private repos  
**Tracking:** config_changelog.md prevents breaking changes

## Session Management Discoveries

### Handover Quality Metrics
**Critical Success Factors:**
1. Next developer can continue in <5 minutes
2. No critical information exists only in previous developer's head
3. Decision rationale is preserved, not just implementation
4. Priority queue is current and actionable

**Warning Signs of Poor Handover:**
- Vague task descriptions
- Missing decision rationale
- Outdated priority lists
- Information buried in commit messages only

### Context Preservation Strategies
**Three-File System Effectiveness:**
- current_task.md: Immediate context and blockers
- next_task.md: Forward-looking prioritization
- session_summary.md: Historical context and decisions

**Supplementary Documentation:**
- decision_log.md: Why choices were made
- troubleshooting_guide.md: Solutions to common problems
- learning_log.md: Insights and discoveries (this file)

## Technical Architecture Learnings

### Obsidian Integration Requirements
**Format:** Markdown with YAML frontmatter  
**Key Fields:** source, date, tags, content_hash, author  
**Linking:** Use [[wikilinks]] and #tags for connectivity  
**Storage:** vault/notes/ directory structure  

### Error Handling Patterns
**Principle:** Graceful degradation over hard failures  
**Implementation:** Comprehensive logging to vault/logs/  
**User Experience:** --dry-run mode for safe testing  
**Monitoring:** Clear error messages with actionable guidance

## Lessons for Future Development

### Sustainable Development Practices
1. **Documentation first, not documentation last**
2. **Update handover files during development, not at the end**
3. **Capture decision rationale when it's fresh**
4. **Treat session checklist as non-negotiable**
5. **Research existing solutions before building custom ones**

### Risk Management
1. **Document breaking changes immediately**
2. **Test configuration changes thoroughly**
3. **Maintain backward compatibility when possible**
4. **Keep modules self-contained and regenerable**

### Knowledge Management
1. **Update this learning log when insights occur**
2. **Cross-reference related documentation**
3. **Periodically review and consolidate learnings**
4. **Share patterns that work across phases**

## Future Research Areas

### Automation Opportunities
- Automated session summary generation from git commits
- Configuration validation on startup
- Link checking for documentation integrity
- Automated backup of critical documentation

### Tool Integration Possibilities
- Obsidian plugin for IntelForge notes
- Git hooks for documentation validation
- CI/CD integration for documentation testing
- Metrics collection for handover quality
