# Detailed Plan for GitHub Projects Automation

## 1. Project Board Setup

- Create a GitHub Projects (Beta) board in the AgentForge repository
- Define columns representing workflow stages, e.g.:
  - Backlog
  - To Do
  - In Progress
  - Review
  - Done
- Configure automation rules for moving cards based on issue and PR status changes

## 2. Issue and Pull Request Templates

- Create standardized templates for issues and PRs including:
  - Task description
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Labels for categorization (e.g., feature, bug, documentation)
- Include metadata fields to facilitate automation triggers

## 3. Commit Message Conventions

- Adopt Conventional Commits or a similar structured format
- Use keywords to indicate task progress, e.g.:
  - feat: new feature
  - fix: bug fix
  - docs: documentation update
  - chore: maintenance tasks
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages to link commits to tasks

## 4. GitHub Actions Workflows

- Develop workflows triggered on:
  - Issue opened, closed, or labeled
  - Pull request opened, merged, or closed
  - Push events with commit messages matching conventions
- Actions to perform:
  - Move project board cards between columns
  - Update status labels on issues and PRs
  - Append progress summaries to markdown status files in the repo
- Ensure workflows handle error cases and provide logs for troubleshooting

## 5. Documentation and Maintenance

- Document all templates, conventions, and workflows in the `automation/github-projects` folder
- Provide guidelines for contributors on how to use the system
- Schedule periodic reviews of automation effectiveness and update as needed

## 6. Future Enhancements

- Integrate notifications for status changes via email or chat
- Add dashboards for visualizing project metrics
- Extend automation to other repositories or cross-project tracking
- Consider integrating advanced logging with Loguru or centralized log management tools
- Plan for automated changelog generation using tools like semantic-release or auto-changelog
- Explore documentation site generation with MkDocs, Sphinx, or alternatives like Docusaurus
- Evaluate integration of monitoring and observability tools for runtime insights

This plan will be implemented incrementally, starting with board setup and templates, followed by automation workflows, and finally documentation and refinement.
