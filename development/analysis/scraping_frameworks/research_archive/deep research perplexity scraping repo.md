## Handling of JS-Rendered Content by Leading News Scraper Projects

### Overview

Modern news sites often load content dynamically using JavaScript, requiring scrapers to execute scripts and wait for the DOM to update before extracting data. Here’s how the most popular prebuilt news article scrapers address this challenge:

### 1. **Newspaper4k**

- **Native Support:** Newspaper4k does not natively execute JavaScript. By default, it only processes the static HTML returned from the initial HTTP request.
- **Workarounds:** The project’s documentation and tutorials provide explicit examples for integrating with Playwright or Selenium. Users can use these tools to render the page, extract the fully loaded HTML, and then pass it to Newspaper4k for parsing. This approach is effective but requires additional setup and code[1][2][3].
- **Summary:** Handles JS-rendered content *well* when combined with Playwright or Selenium, but not out-of-the-box.

### 2. **news-please**

- **Native Support:** news-please is designed for static HTML extraction and does not execute JavaScript or support dynamic content natively.
- **Workarounds:** Users must manually integrate browser automation tools (e.g., Selenium, Playwright) to fetch rendered HTML before passing it to news-please for extraction.
- **Summary:** *Limited* support for JS-rendered content; requires external browser automation for dynamic sites.

### 3. **Fundus**

- **Native Support:** Fundus is a static news crawler and does not support JavaScript execution or dynamic content rendering. It is optimized for large-scale crawling of static news sites and the CommonCrawl dataset[4][5].
- **Summary:** *Not suitable* for JS-heavy or single-page application news sites.

### 4. **General Browser Automation Tools**

- **Playwright & Selenium:** Both are widely used for scraping dynamic content. Playwright is particularly praised for its modern architecture, automatic waits, and robust handling of complex, JS-heavy sites. Selenium is mature and flexible but often requires more explicit waits and setup for dynamic content[6][7][8][9].
- **Integration:** Most Python-based scrapers (including Newspaper4k and news-please) can be paired with Playwright or Selenium to handle dynamic content. The workflow involves rendering the page in a headless browser, extracting the HTML, and then parsing it with the scraper library.

### Feature Comparison Table

| Project         | Native JS Support | Playwright/Selenium Integration | Ease of Use for Dynamic Sites | Notes                                      |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Newspaper4k     | No               | Yes (documented)              | Moderate                     | Requires extra code for dynamic content[1][2] |
| news-please     | No               | Yes (manual)                  | Moderate                     | No built-in dynamic support                 |
| Fundus          | No               | No                            | Low                          | Static sites only[4][5]                    |

### Key Takeaways

- **No major prebuilt Python news scrapers natively handle JS-rendered content.**
- **Best practice:** Use Playwright or Selenium to render dynamic pages, then pass the HTML to your chosen scraper.
- **Playwright** is generally preferred for new projects due to its speed, reliability, and ease of handling modern web apps[6][7][8].
- **Static-only scrapers** (like Fundus) are not suitable for sites where news content is loaded or updated via JavaScript.

**In summary:**  
To robustly scrape news from JS-heavy or dynamic sites, combine a browser automation tool (Playwright or Selenium) with your preferred extraction library. This hybrid approach is well-documented and widely used in the web scraping community[-----------------------------------------
