Deep Research with Claude Sonnet 4 in Claude Code

  Core Research Capabilities

  1. Multi-Modal Research Tools

  - WebFetch: Fetch and analyze web content with AI processing
  - WebSearch: Real-time web search with domain filtering
  - Task: Launch specialized research agents with full toolset access
  - File Analysis: Read code, documents, images, and notebooks
  - GitHub Integration: Deep repository analysis and code exploration

  2. Advanced Search Strategies

  Parallel Information Gathering:
  # Multiple concurrent searches
  WebSearch: "algorithmic trading strategies 2024"
  WebFetch: "https://arxiv.org/list/q-fin.TR/recent"
  Task: "Find top 10 GitHub repos for quantitative finance"

  Layered Research Approach:
  1. Broad Discovery → WebSearch for overview
  2. Deep Dive → WebFetch specific sources
  3. Code Analysis → GitHub integration for implementations
  4. Validation → Cross-reference multiple sources

  3. Research Methodologies

  Academic Research Pattern:
  1. Literature review via WebSearch
  2. Primary source analysis via WebFetch
  3. Code implementation study via GitHub tools
  4. Synthesis and documentation

  Market Intelligence Pattern:
  1. News aggregation (WebSearch with date filters)
  2. Technical documentation (WebFetch with specific prompts)
  3. Repository analysis (GitHub trending/popular)
  4. Community insights (Reddit/Discord via WebFetch)

  4. Specialized Research Workflows

  Technical Deep Dive:
  - Use Task tool for complex multi-step research
  - Leverage Grep and Glob for codebase analysis
  - Use Read for detailed file examination
  - Apply mcp__* tools for specialized data sources

  Competitive Analysis:
  - GitHub repository comparison
  - Documentation analysis
  - Feature matrix creation
  - Performance benchmarking research

  5. Research Organization

  Information Architecture:
  - Use Write for research summaries
  - Create structured markdown reports
  - Build knowledge graphs with findings
  - Maintain research logs and decision trails

  Best Practices:
  - Batch Tool Calls: Use multiple tools in single messages for efficiency
  - Iterative Refinement: Start broad, then narrow focus
  - Source Verification: Cross-reference multiple sources
  - Structured Documentation: Use consistent markdown formatting

  6. Advanced Research Techniques

  Domain-Specific Research:
  # Financial markets
  WebSearch: "quantitative finance papers 2024" + allowed_domains: ["arxiv.org", "ssrn.com"]

  # Technology trends
  WebSearch: "AI framework benchmarks" + blocked_domains: ["pinterest.com", "instagram.com"]

  Time-Sensitive Research:
  - Use WebSearch for current events and recent developments
  - WebFetch for real-time data analysis
  - GitHub tools for latest repository updates

  Cross-Domain Analysis:
  - Combine technical, business, and academic sources
  - Use Task tool for complex multi-domain research
  - Synthesize findings across different knowledge areas

  Claude Code's research capabilities are particularly powerful when you combine multiple tools strategically and leverage the parallel processing capabilities. The key is to think systematically about your research questions and use the right tool combination for each phase.
