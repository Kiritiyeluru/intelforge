  - Automatic driver download and patching
  - Works with Brave and other Chromium browsers
  - **Note**: Now succeeded by nodriver

## **Stealth Plugin Solutions**

### **7. Playwright Stealth**[9]
- **Repository**: Various implementations (`playwright-stealth`)
- **Description**: Stealth plugin for Playwright ported from Puppeteer Extra
- **Key Features**:
  - Proof-of-concept for basic bot detection bypass
  - Easy integration with existing Playwright code
  - **Limitation**: Only bypasses simple detection methods

### **8. Selenium Stealth**[10]
- **Repository**: `diprajpatra/selenium-stealth`
- **Description**: Python package to make Selenium more stealthy
- **Key Features**:
  - Passes most public bot tests
  - Enables Google account login with Selenium
  - Maintains normal reCAPTCHA v3 scores
  - Chrome/Chromium support only

### **9. Scrapling**[11]
- **Repository**: `D4Vinci/Scrapling`
- **Description**: Undetectable, high-performance Python web scraping library
- **Key Features**:
  - Multiple fetcher types including StealthyFetcher
  - Auto-matching for website structure changes
  - Built-in proxy support

## **Specialized Tools**

### **10. Selenium Driverless**[12]
- **Repository**: `kaliiiiiiiiii/Selenium-Driverless`
- **Description**: Selenium without ChromeDriver for maximum stealth
- **Key Features**:
  - Currently passes Cloudflare, Bet365, Turnstile
  - Multiple tabs and incognito contexts
  - Proxy authentication support
  - Network interception capabilities

### **11. Anti-Scraping Toolkit**[13]
- **Repository**: `thalissonvs/antiscraping-toolkit`
- **Description**: Comprehensive guide and tools for handling web scraping blocks
- **Key Features**:
  - Educational resource on detection mechanisms
  - Server-side and browser-side detection analysis
  - Fingerprinting techniques documentation

### **12. Stealth Requests**[14]
- **Repository**: `jpjacobpadilla/Stealth-Requests`
- **Description**: Undetected web scraping using realistic HTTP requests
- **Key Features**:
  - Mimics browser headers for file type adaptation
  - TLS fingerprint masking via curl_cffi
  - Dynamic header tracking (Referer, Host)
  - Faster parsing and automatic metadata extraction

## **Framework Integrations**

### **13. Scrapy-Playwright-Stealth**[15]
- **Repository**: `scrapy-playwright-stealth`
- **Description**: Wrapper for scrapy-playwright with integrated stealth features
- **Key Features**:
  - Automatic stealth application to all pages
  - Drop-in replacement for standard scrapy-playwright
  - Minimal configuration required

## **Detection Testing Tools**

### **14. Browser Fingerprinting Analysis**[16]
- **Repository**: `niespodd/browser-fingerprinting`
- **Description**: Analysis of bot protection bypassing techniques
- **Key Features**:
  - Comprehensive anti-bot software provider list
  - Available stealth browsers comparison
  - Technical insights into bypassing detection

## **Key Recommendations**

**For Maximum Stealth**: Use **Camoufox**[3] - it consistently performs best against fingerprinting tests and is designed specifically for anti-detection.

**For Performance**: Use **Nodriver**[1] or its fork **Zendriver**[6] - they provide the fastest async scraping with excellent stealth capabilities.

**For Drop-in Replacement**: Use **Rebrowser patches**[5] - they require no code changes and work with existing Puppeteer/Playwright scripts.

**For Educational Purposes**: Start with **Anti-Scraping Toolkit**[13] to understand detection mechanisms before implementing solutions.

**Important Notes**:
- Many traditional stealth plugins like `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth` are outdated and easily detected by modern anti-bot systems[17]
- CDP (Chrome Developer Protocol) detection is a major concern in 2024[18]
- IP reputation and datacenter detection remain significant challenges regardless of browser stealth[8]

These repositories represent the current state-of-the-art in anti-detection web scraping, with active development and proven effectiveness against modern anti-bot systems.
