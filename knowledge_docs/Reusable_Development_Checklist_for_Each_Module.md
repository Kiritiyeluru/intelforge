Thank you for the clarification — you're referring to a **modular, reusable development checklist** that can be applied to **every module or stage**, with principles like *reuse over rebuild*, *failure resilience*, *modularity*, and *AI-readiness* baked in.

Here’s the **Refined Reusable Development Checklist**, optimized for:

* ✅ **Solo development**
* 🤖 **AI-assisted coding**
* 🔁 **Iterative improvement**
* 🧩 **Unstructured, scratch-built, personal-use systems**
* 🧠 **Your learning process (not just final product)**

# 🔁 **Reusable Development Checklist for Each Module/Stage**

> 📌 *Use this every time you design or revise a script, function, or subsystem.*

### 🔍 **1. Reuse Over Rebuild**

| Question                                                                      | Why it Matters                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ☐ Did I check for existing libraries, APIs, or tools that already do this?    | Saves time, ensures reliability         |
| ☐ Am I reinventing something that’s already well-supported and tested?        | Avoids fragile DIY solutions            |
| ☐ Can this module wrap an external tool or service rather than rebuild logic? | Turns messy logic into clean interfaces |

---

### 🧱 **2. Clear Interfaces & Modularity**

| Question                                                                 | Why it Matters                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| ☐ Are input/output formats clearly defined?                              | Prevents ambiguity in data flow |
| ☐ Does this module work independently with mock/test data?               | Makes testing and reuse easier  |
| ☐ Can this module be used in isolation (CLI flag, test mode, etc.)?      | Encourages plug-and-play design |
| ☐ Is this a *function* or *script*? (Functions are preferred for reuse.) | Enables chaining and reuse      |

---

### ⚠️ **3. Resilience by Default**

| Question                                                       | Why it Matters                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ☐ What happens if the input is bad or missing?                 | Avoids silent crashes                         |
| ☐ What if the API fails? Is there retry, fallback, or logging? | Makes automation reliable                     |
| ☐ Is there a log or error output for every failure case?       | Helps debugging without stepping through code |

---

### 🧠 **4. AI-Friendliness**

| Question                                                                      | Why it Matters                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ☐ Is my prompt clear, scoped, and complete (purpose, format, error handling)? | Better AI output, less need to revise |
| ☐ Did I request docstrings and inline comments?                               | Makes the code explain itself         |
| ☐ Did I ask for a dry-run mode or sample data generator?                      | Safe testing without side effects     |
| ☐ Did I save the prompt and result for reuse or versioning?                   | Builds your personal prompt library   |

---

### 🔒 **5. Configuration, Not Hardcoding**

| Question                                                                        | Why it Matters                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ☐ Are file paths, credentials, and flags in a config file?                      | Easier to update or switch environments |
| ☐ Can I change behavior without editing the code?                               | Makes maintenance less painful          |
| ☐ Did I avoid burying values like `"output/"`, `"api_key"`, etc. in the script? | Encourages portability                  |

---

### 🧪 **6. Testability and Observability**

| Question                                                         | Why it Matters                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| ☐ Can I run this module with sample or mock data?                | Makes it easy to verify                 |
| ☐ Do I have log messages for key events (start, success, error)? | Understand what happened later          |
| ☐ Is there a simple way to validate this worked?                 | Adds trust and sanity checks            |
| ☐ Should I add a `--dry-run` or `--verbose` flag?                | Lets you test before committing results |

---

### ♻️ **7. Regeneration-Friendly Design**

| Question                                                               | Why it Matters               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ☐ Is this small and focused enough to regenerate with AI if it breaks? | Keeps debugging localized    |
| ☐ Can I explain this module’s job in 1–2 lines for AI prompts?         | Easier to recover or improve |
| ☐ Do I know exactly which file/function to rework if there’s a bug?    | Speeds up feedback loop      |

---

### 🧼 **8. Clean Exit and Reset Logic**

| Question                                                           | Why it Matters                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| ☐ Is there a cleanup script or option to reset files/logs safely?  | Helps during testing and iteration |
| ☐ Does it fail silently or loudly when something goes wrong?       | Loud failures are easier to fix    |
| ☐ Do I prevent overwriting or deleting real data unless confirmed? | Avoids accidental loss             |

---

### 📁 **9. Folder and File Hygiene**

| Question                                                                         | Why it Matters                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ☐ Are outputs saved in a structured location (e.g., `vault/notes/`, `logs/`)?    | Makes data easy to find and version |
| ☐ Do I timestamp files when needed?                                              | Supports history and rollback       |
| ☐ Are filenames clear and scoped (e.g., `github_fetch_bollinger_2025-06-08.md`)? | Prevents overwrites and confusion   |

---

### 🗃️ **10. Self-Documentation**

| Question                                                             | Why it Matters                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ☐ Does the script explain what it does at the top?                   | Helps AI and future-you           |
| ☐ Is there a short usage guide in the file (`# Usage:` comment)?     | Prevents forgetting how to run it |
| ☐ Did I add a README, prompt, or plan file if this is a major phase? | Documents intention and design    |
