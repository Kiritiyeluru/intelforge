Yes, **you absolutely need to track already-scraped URLs** ‚Äî and **no, it's not automatically handled** unless you explicitly build it into your pipeline.

## üö® Reality Check: Why You Must Track Scraped URLs

### 1. **No Built-in Dedup by Most Crawlers**

Unless you‚Äôve implemented `seen_urls` or a dedup middleware (e.g., in Scrapy or Crawl4AI), the crawler **doesn‚Äôt remember** what it already visited between runs.

### 2. **Redundant Fetch = Wasted Bandwidth + Processing**

* **Repeated downloads**
* **Redundant LLM summaries**
* **Bloated datasets**

This kills efficiency, especially once you scale to thousands of URLs.

## ‚úÖ What You Should Store

| What           | Why                                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `url`          | Basic ID, used for dedup/skip                |
| `content_hash` | Detect changed content (even if URL is same) |
| `last_scraped` | Useful for periodic refreshes                |
| `site`         | Helps with grouping and batch invalidation   |

## üß† Suggested Structure

### Option 1: **Local SQLite DB**

Simple, persistent, no infra needed.

```sql
CREATE TABLE scraped_pages (
  url TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  content_hash TEXT,
  last_scraped TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Option 2: **Flat JSONL/CSV Log**

Append every successful scrape:

```json
{"url": "https://abc.com/page1", "content_hash": "abc123", "date": "2025-07-19"}
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Smart Optimization

If you want to go beyond just checking URL:

* Compare **`content_hash`** to detect changes on dynamic pages
* Use `ETag` or `Last-Modified` HTTP headers (if supported by target site)

---

## üîß Need This Feature?

I can build you a lightweight dedup engine that:

* Checks SQLite or flat file before scrape
* Adds new URLs after scrape
* Supports "refresh if modified"

Want this as a Python module you can plug into your crawler? Just say the word.
