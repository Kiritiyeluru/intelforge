You're ready — this is the moment to shift from building to **running**.

Here's a clear, structured prompt you can paste into your **VS Code AI assistant** (like GitHub Copilot Chat or CodeGPT) to start using your semantic crawler in production mode, **scheduled to run every night**:

### 🧠 **Prompt to Your AI in VS Code**:

````
I have a production-ready semantic crawler called `intelforge`.

I want to schedule it to run **every night at 2:00 AM**, crawl a list of finance-related websites stored in `config/targets_finance.txt`, and **save the results** to a timestamped directory like `data_runs/YYYYMMDD/`.

Here’s what I need:

1. **Create a cron job or scheduling script** that activates my virtual environment (`venv/bin/activate`) and runs this command:

    ```bash
    python scripts/cli.py sync --input config/targets_finance.txt --save-raw
    ```

2. Before running, ensure:
    - The virtual environment is activated
    - Logs are saved to `logs/intelforge_nightly.log`
    - The output is saved to a new subfolder: `data_runs/20250720/` (based on current date)

3. Add logic to:
    - Create the folder `data_runs/YYYYMMDD/` if it doesn’t exist
    - Automatically clean up folders older than 14 days (optional)

4. Output a ready-to-run `.sh` script and the exact `crontab` line I should add to schedule it.

Optional:
- Also show how I can trigger the script manually with a `just sync-nightly` command using `justfile`.

Keep it clean, log-rich, and safe to run unattended.

### ✅ Additional Details You Should Consider Telling Your AI Assistant

| Area                   | Info to Include                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Output Format**      | JSON, Markdown, plain text?                  |
| **Log Storage**        | Whether to rotate logs or append             |
| **Failure Handling**   | Retry, email alert, fallback target list?    |
| **Data Sensitivity**   | If PII or auth is involved                   |
| **Health Monitoring**  | Whether to include health check before/after |
| **System Constraints** | Limited bandwidth or machine usage at night? |

### 🚀 Sample Cron Output (What AI Might Generate)

```bash
# Run semantic crawler every day at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /home/kiriti/intelforge/cron/nightly_crawl.sh >> /home/kiriti/intelforge/logs/nightly_cron.log 2>&1
```

And inside `nightly_crawl.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
source /home/kiriti/intelforge/venv/bin/activate
TODAY=$(date +%Y%m%d)
mkdir -p /home/kiriti/intelforge/data_runs/$TODAY
python /home/kiriti/intelforge/scripts/cli.py sync \
  --input /home/kiriti/intelforge/config/targets_finance.txt \
  --save-raw \
  --output-dir /home/kiriti/intelforge/data_runs/$TODAY \
  >> /home/kiriti/intelforge/logs/intelforge_nightly.log 2>&1
```

Here are my direct answers and preferences to move forward efficiently:

---

## ✅ **Answers to IntelForge Implementation Questions**

### 1. **CLI Interface**

> ❓ *Does `scripts/cli.py` exist with a `sync` command?*

✅ **Yes** — I already have a working CLI (`scripts/cli.py`) and a functional `sync` command that runs the crawler end-to-end.
🔧 If migrating to Crawl4AI, we will need to adapt the internals but **preserve the CLI** for compatibility.

---

### 2. **Target Configuration**

> ❓ *Does `config/targets_finance.txt` exist?*

🔄 **Partially** — I have some files like this, but if not already present, I will create one.
✅ **Format**: One URL per line (plain `.txt` file).

---

### 3. **Output Directory Structure**

> ❓ *Should I integrate into existing IntelForge structure?*

✅ **Yes** — Follow the existing directory layout.
Recommended:

```
data_runs/YYYYMMDD/  ← For nightly outputs
logs/intelforge_nightly.log  ← For logs
```

---

### 4. **Logging Integration**

> ❓ *Integrate with IntelForge's logging system?*

✅ **Yes** — Use the existing logging setup (`structured logging with Rich`), but write a **separate nightly log file** to avoid noise in the main logs:

```bash
logs/intelforge_nightly.log
```

---

### 5. **Virtual Environment**

> ❓ *Is venv located at `/home/kiriti/alpha_projects/intelforge/venv/`?*

✅ **Correct.**
Use this full path in automation scripts:

```bash
source /home/kiriti/alpha_projects/intelforge/venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 🛠️ **Preferred Implementation Option**

### ✅ **Hybrid Approach**

> Set up scheduling **now** using the current semantic crawler and CLI, but **structure it to easily swap in Crawl4AI later.**

Why:

* You get immediate utility from your current code.
* Migration to Crawl4AI can be a single-line drop-in.
* It avoids waiting to use your system just because upgrades are pending.

---

## 🔜 **Next Actions (What I Want You to Do)**

✅ Go ahead and:

* ✅ **Check the existing CLI and reuse it**
* ✅ **Set up the scheduling infrastructure**
* ✅ **Create the production-ready nightly crawler script** (cron + `justfile`)

Optional enhancements later:

* Swap in `semantic_crawler_v2.py` based on Crawl4AI.
* Add health check + retry on failure.
