You're thinking in the right direction ‚Äî **prebuilding a large URL queue and letting the crawler chew through it is smart**, especially for a solo deployment.

But let‚Äôs be clear on what **is** and **is not** recommended:

---

## ‚úÖ YES ‚Äî Building a Huge Scrape URL Queue

**Pros:**

* Full control over what gets scraped
* Avoids repeated crawl of junk or noise
* Easy to restart/resume from failures

**Conditions:**

* Only makes sense if URLs are relatively stable (e.g., GitHub repos, blog posts, article archives)
* Your content doesn't change hourly (e.g., not live news or stocks)

---

## ‚ùå NO ‚Äî Don‚Äôt Expect the Crawler to *Find* the URLs on Its Own (By Default)

Your crawler (e.g. Scrapy) **can follow links recursively**, but that‚Äôs not the same as **discovering high-quality strategy-rich URLs across the web.**

**Reasons to avoid full auto-discovery**:

* Link-following finds too much garbage
* No semantic filtering (you‚Äôll waste 90% of crawl budget)
* You‚Äôll get blocked faster if you hit entire domains blindly

## üí° Your Real Question:

> *Is there a tool that searches the web (e.g. for blog posts or GitHub strategies) and gives me URLs I can queue into the crawler?*

**YES. And here‚Äôs a ranked list of tools** that can automate URL discovery with high ROI for your use case.

| **RSS Aggregators (e.g., RSSHub)**            | Crawl GitHub commits, arXiv, SSRN, blogs                                            | Auto-discover new posts and URLs          | ‚úÖ Free                       |
| **GitHub Search + `ghapi`**                   | Search for strategy repos, notebooks, indicator code                                | Extract URLs to crawl                     | ‚úÖ Free                       |
| **Pushshift API (Reddit)**                    | Extract all Reddit posts with "strategy" or "backtest"                              | Harvest deep discussions                  | ‚úÖ Free (may need proxies)    |
| **Common Crawl or Webis-Touche**              | Use pre-indexed web snapshot datasets to extract URLs with strategy-related content | Get millions of URLs from public archives | üß† Advanced (one-time job)   |
| **Farside or SearXNG**                        | Self-hosted meta-search engines that can dump search results into URL queues        | Total control, privacy                    | üõ†Ô∏è High effort but powerful |

## üß© Ideal Strategy (Your Use Case)

1. **Batch URL Extraction Phase**

   * Use GitHub API + Reddit + targeted Google dorking to build a massive `urls.jsonl` queue.
   * Store metadata: source, category, discovery date.

2. **Feed into Crawler (Scrapy or your custom agent)**

   * Enable URL deduplication (`content_hash`, or `fingerprint`)
   * Respect domain-specific crawl delays to avoid bans

3. **Run Until Queue Exhaustion**

   * This lets you **scrape once, enrich once, embed once**, and only refresh incrementally.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools I‚Äôd Actually Recommend (Low Friction)

* **GitHub + `ghapi`** ‚Äî high-quality repo URLs, 100% relevant
* **RSSHub or `feedparser`** ‚Äî passive but reliable
* **Google Programmable Search JSON API** ‚Äî 100 free searches/day
* **Reddit + Pushshift** ‚Äî surface rare strategies and community links
* **Your own `seed_urls.yaml` + `tag` per domain** ‚Äî to keep crawl organized
