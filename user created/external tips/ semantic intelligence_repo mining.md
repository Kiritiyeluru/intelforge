### 🧮 4. **Feature Engineering & ML Preprocessing**

> Use semantic + numeric features for hybrid strategies

#### 🔍 What to Look For:

* Indicator feature generation
* NLP sentiment fusion (news/headlines)
* Time series transformations

#### ✅ Repos:

* [`ta`](https://github.com/bukosabino/ta) – over 130 technical indicators
* [`finRL`](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL)

## 🧠 Bonus: High-Leverage Meta Tools to Study

| Tool                                     | Purpose                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `jupyter-book`, `mkdocs`, `literate-nav` | For auto-generating research docs from strategy code    |
| `joblib`, `ray`, `dask`                  | For fast parallel ML backtesting                        |
| `mlflow`, `wandb`, `optuna`              | For tracking hyperparameters, experiments, optimization |

## ✅ Next Step: Build a Research Board

You can structure your GitHub repo scouting using these categories:

```markdown
## Algo Trading Research Map

### ✅ Strategy Extraction
- [repo] – good breakout logic
- [repo] – ML-based scoring

### 📊 Backtesting
- [repo] – multi-timeframe engine
- [repo] – vectorbt test layer

...
```

I can help you generate a GitHub Projects Kanban board or justfile targets to crawl, flatten, and score these repos.

---

Would you like a pre-written script to:

* Crawl top repos in each category
* Convert to `.txt`
* Score semantically for usefulness
* Tag with metadata (stars, forks, last commit)?

You’re close to building a **semantic research engine for financial infrastructure** — with minimal glue and maximum leverage.
