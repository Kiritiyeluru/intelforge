To run a **personal algorithmic trading system**, even as a solo developer, here's what is *absolutely essential* — no fluff, just the critical components you **must** have for a real-world, self-sufficient setup. Based on your roadmap (IntelForge) and best practices from quant research to production deployment, here’s the minimum viable system:

---

## 🔧 **Core System Components (Non-Negotiable)**

### 1. **Semantic Strategy Discovery + Extraction**

* ✅ You already built this (semantic crawler) — excellent head start.
* **Must-Have**:

  * Content parsing and code block extraction (`trafilatura`, `boilerpy3`)
  * Strategy logic and parameter recognition (LLM or regex-based extractor)
  * YAML+Markdown output for traceability

### 2. **Strategy Code Generator + Validator**

* ⚠️ Not implemented yet — required.
* Auto-generate trading strategy code from extracted rules.
* Validate syntax with `flake8`, `black`, `mypy`.
* Output format: Freqtrade-compatible `.py` scripts.

### 3. **Backtesting Engine**

* ✅ You're aligned on this.
* Use **`vectorbt`** or **`Freqtrade`** (Freqtrade better for discrete rules + paper/live trade).
* Run batch backtests using extracted strategies.
* Save performance metrics (Sharpe, drawdown, etc.) to SQLite/CSV.

### 4. **Strategy Selector**

* Logic to filter out garbage backtests.
* Thresholds like:

  * `Sharpe > 1.5`
  * `Max Drawdown < 20%`
  * `Profit factor > 1.3`
* Move top performers to a “selected” folder.

### 5. **Portfolio Allocator**

* Combine 3–5 uncorrelated strategies.
* Capital weighting based on risk (inverse drawdown, Sharpe, etc.).
* Rebalance weekly or monthly.

---

## 🚦 **Execution + Automation**

### 6. **Paper Trading + Live Trading Engine**

* Freqtrade supports both out-of-the-box.
* Use TrueData or Binance/Alpaca for live data + execution APIs.
* Start in paper mode to detect slippage, data issues.

### 7. **Scheduler / Orchestration**

* Use `n8n`, `cron`, or `Airflow` to automate:

  * Daily semantic crawl
  * Weekly backtest batch run
  * Strategy evaluation and report generation

---

## 🧠 **Monitoring + Intelligence Layer**

### 8. **System Health Dashboard**

* CLI or Notion/Grafana dashboard showing:

  * Number of crawled sources
  * Backtest summary metrics
  * Crawl failures / threshold drift
  * Vector DB growth

### 9. **Fingerprinting + Drift Detection**

* Hash semantic embeddings of articles and models.
* Detect if the same URL outputs something drastically different (i.e., model config drift or content changes).

---

## 🔐 **Safety + Maintainability**

### 10. **Audit Trail / Vault**

* Store every strategy’s:

  * Source URL
  * Parameters
  * Code version
  * Backtest result
  * Notes
* YAML/Markdown or SQLite/Notion.

### 11. **Fail-Safes and Alerts**

* Slack/email/CLI alerts if:

  * No crawl for 48 hours
  * ChromaDB stops growing
  * No new valid strategies in X days

---

## 🛠️ Optional but Highly Useful

* `txtai` or `Haystack`: Local RAG for querying your strategy vault
* `Scrapfly` or `SmartProxy`: Stealth scraping for rate-limited or bot-blocked sites
* `LangChain` or `InstructorEmbedding`: For smarter document segmentation and similarity comparison
* **A/B Strategy Testing Harness**: Run two scoring methods in parallel to compare performance

## 🧩 Summary Table: Must-Haves

| Component                            | You Have It? | Critical for Solo? | Notes                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Semantic Crawler                     | ✅            | ✅                  | Already built. Optimize further.            |
| Strategy Extractor                   | ⚠️           | ✅                  | Next priority. LLM or rules-based.          |
| Code Generator + Validator           | ⚠️           | ✅                  | Auto-convert logic to Freqtrade format.     |
| Backtest Engine (vectorbt/Freqtrade) | ✅            | ✅                  | Use vectorbt for batch, Freqtrade for live. |
| Strategy Selector + Filter           | ⚠️           | ✅                  | Set up rule-based filters (Sharpe/DD).      |
| Portfolio Allocator                  | ⚠️           | ✅                  | Simple rebalancer script needed.            |
| Paper/Live Trading Engine            | ⚠️           | ✅                  | Freqtrade preferred. Connect APIs.          |
| Scheduler (n8n/Airflow/cron)         | ⚠️           | ✅                  | Automate full loop.                         |
| Monitoring + Audit Trail             | ⚠️           | ✅                  | Use Markdown + Notion/DB + alerting.        |

Let me know if you want a working starter template for:

* 🚀 Code generator + validator
* 📊 SQLite-based backtest result tracker
* 📅 n8n cron workflows for daily crawl + weekly backtest
* 📁 Folder structure for strategy vaults with Markdown/YAML

We’ll turn this system into something that even small quant teams would envy.
