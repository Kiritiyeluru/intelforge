Got it — you're referring to the doc you uploaded:
📄 **`REF_A_LONGTERM_STRATEGY_CONSOLIDATION_20250717_v1_CL.md`**

I’ve gone through it thoroughly. Here's the blunt, prioritized breakdown of **what you should focus on first**, specifically for building a **solo-deployable, long-term algorithmic trading system**.

---

## 🧠 **1. Core Strategic Focus Areas (From the Doc)**

### ✅ 1.1 **Extraction-to-Backtest Loop**

> 📌 **From Sections:** Strategy Semantics → Code Extraction → Backtest Frameworks

* **Why it matters:** This is the *engine* of your system. Without this loop working, you're flying blind.
* **What to build immediately:**

  * Extract parameters + logic from articles/repos.
  * Auto-generate strategy files (Freqtrade format).
  * Batch backtest with `vectorbt` or `Freqtrade`.

**Your Priority:**
✅ Start with semantic extraction → code generator → backtester.
This is the tightest feedback loop to iterate and improve strategy quality.

---

### ✅ 1.2 **Vaulting + Version Control**

> 📌 **From Sections:** Strategy Tracker, Audit History, Drift Logs

* **Why it matters:** If you can't track **what** worked and **why**, you'll repeat bad strategies or forget winners.
* **What to implement:**

  * Store every strategy with metadata:

    * Source URL
    * Parsed YAML logic
    * Parameters
    * Backtest summary
    * Date crawled, versioned hash
  * Format: `.md` + `.yaml` + JSON + backtest CSVs per strategy.

**Your Priority:**
✅ Build a versioned folder-based strategy vault system — simple, fast, and traceable.

---

### ⚠️ 1.3 **Model + Config Drift Detection**

> 📌 **From Sections:** Drift, Scoring Drift, Model Fingerprinting

* **Why it matters:** As LLMs update or sources change, same inputs could produce different outputs.
* **What to implement:**

  * Save embedding or hash of every parsed document.
  * Compare new crawls to old fingerprints.
  * If >20% difference: flag for manual review.

**Your Priority:**
⚠️ Medium priority — not blocking, but essential to avoid silent bugs later.

---

### ⚠️ 1.4 **Backtest Strategy Filtering**

> 📌 **From Sections:** Evaluation Layer, Strategy Classifiers

* **Why it matters:** You'll end up with dozens of backtests — you need logic to **filter out garbage**.
* **What to build:**

  * JSON config with rule thresholds:

    ```json
    {
      "min_sharpe": 1.5,
      "max_drawdown": 0.25,
      "min_pnl": 5
    }
    ```
  * CLI to evaluate result files and move strategies to "shortlist" folder.

**Your Priority:**
✅ Build this immediately after your backtesting loop.

---

### ⚠️ 1.5 **Live/Paper Trading Prep**

> 📌 **From Sections:** Strategy Deployment, Trading Infrastructure

* **Why it matters:** You don’t need live trading now — but your whole pipeline should be “Freqtrade-ready.”
* **What to prep:**

  * Keep strategies in the Freqtrade strategy format.
  * Build paper trading shell scripts.
  * Start testing with mock data or paper broker (TrueData/Alpaca/Binance testnet).

**Your Priority:**
⚠️ Don’t rush live trading. Just make sure the format/output can plug into Freqtrade easily.

## 🎯 TL;DR — What to Focus on (Solo Priority)

| Rank | Focus Area                          | Description                                                    | From Doc Section                        |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 🥇 1 | **Semantic → Code → Backtest Loop** | Extract logic → generate strategy → test                       | Strategy Semantics, Backtest Frameworks |
| 🥈 2 | **Versioned Strategy Vault**        | Track source, logic, results, versions                         | Strategy Tracker, Audit Logs            |
| 🥉 3 | **Backtest Evaluator / Filter**     | Auto-filter based on Sharpe/DD/PnL                             | Evaluation Layer                        |
| ✅ 4  | **Drift Detection**                 | Fingerprint sources and model config outputs                   | Scoring Drift, Fingerprints             |
| 🔜 5 | **Freqtrade Compatibility**         | Ensure strategies are compatible with paper/live trading later | Strategy Deployment                     |

## 💬 Final Word

You don’t need all 40 sections in that doc to go live.
But if you nail just the **first 3 items above**, you’ll have:

* A full ingestion-to-backtest pipeline
* A traceable strategy history
* A filtering logic that gives you real signal

Let me know if you want me to generate:

* Starter folder structure for the strategy vault
* JSON ruleset for backtest filtering
* YAML template for semantic strategy output

Let’s ship something real.
