If this is **personal use**, **low-volume**, and you're being **ethical and careful**, here‚Äôs what you can **safely skip** or **loosen** to maximize scraping performance **without being reckless**:

## ‚úÖ SAFE-TO-SKIP (for solo devs with low-frequency use)

| Feature                                    | Skip? | Why You Can                                                                  | What to Watch Out For                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `--respect-robots-txt`                     | ‚úÖ     | You‚Äôre not abusing, just gathering public info                               | Don't hit login/admin paths                |
| `User-Agent` Spoofing                      | ‚úÖ\*   | If sites don‚Äôt block default UA, no need                                     | Add it *only* if site blocks requests      |
| `--backoff-factor` (retry delay)           | ‚úÖ     | Low volume = unlikely to trigger throttling                                  | But add *some* retry logic manually        |
| `--timeout` too low                        | ‚úÖ     | Can lead to false negatives if pages are slow                                | Use a sane default like `10s`, not `2s`    |
| JavaScript rendering (Playwright/Selenium) | ‚úÖ     | Use only if site *needs* it (SPA/dynamic)                                    | Adds huge overhead ‚Äî avoid unless required |
| Proxy rotation / VPN                       | ‚úÖ     | Not needed unless you're scraping aggressive targets like LinkedIn or Amazon | Adds complexity, breaks often              |
| Full HTML archival                         | ‚úÖ     | You just need strategy logic, not the entire page                            | Strip content before storing               |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è YOU *SHOULD NOT* SKIP THESE

| Feature                              | Why You Need It                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--rate-limit`                       | Prevent accidental flood. Always keep at least 1-2s delay    |
| Retry logic (basic)                  | Internet fails. Requests time out. Don‚Äôt lose data silently. |
| Domain filtering (`--limit-domains`) | Keeps crawler from drifting into unwanted sites or ad traps  |
| Threshold filtering (`--threshold`)  | Helps discard low-quality junk early                         |
| Save raw + parsed                    | You want a local trace of what was scraped for debugging     |

---

## üß† Minimalist Personal Setup for IntelForge

```bash
python scripts/semantic_crawler.py \
  --url-file urls_tier1_premium.txt \
  --threshold 0.8 \
  --rate-limit 2 \
  --limit-domains "quantstart.com,quantpedia.com,blog.quantinsti.com" \
  --save-raw
```

**No `--respect-robots-txt`**, no proxies, no headless browser overhead.

## üöÄ If You‚Äôre Curious What Else You Can Trim

* Skip full NLP pipelines unless you're extracting summaries
* Skip vector DB writes during test runs ‚Äî do in batches instead
* Skip full page parsing ‚Äî extract just `title`, `article`, `meta`, `code`

---

## üîö Bottom Line

You can skip a lot ‚Äî as long as:

* You stay **low-volume**
* Avoid scraping gated/private pages
* Use **delays + domain limits**
* Don‚Äôt reuse scraped data commercially or at scale

You‚Äôre good. Strip it down and fly light.
